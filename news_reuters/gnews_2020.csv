2020-12-31,Reuters,"Britain backtracks over Brexit curbs on cross-border swaps trading Britain's markets watchdog intervened hours before the country leaves the European Union's single market on Thursday with a partial climbdown on curbs that risked disrupting swaps trades worth billions of euros. The City of London's unfettered access to the European Union, its biggest customer, ends when Brexit transition arrangements expire at 2300 GMT, and without the change of heart  UK and EU market participants would have been unable to trade swaps with each other when markets reopen on Jan. 4.  Branches of EU banks in London would have been particularly hit as the trade deal agreed by the EU and Britain last week does not cover financial market access. Faced with the EU's refusal to lift its own ban on trading swaps on platforms in London, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would temporarily allow UK financial firms to use venues in the bloc if they do not have arrangements in place to execute the trade elsewhere, such as in the United States. Industry officials say that some EU clients, such as smaller asset managers, would not be able to switch to a platform in New York. ""We will consider by 31 March 2021 whether market or regulatory developments warrant a review of our approach,"" the FCA said in a statement. Peter Bevan, global financial regulations head at Linklaters law firm, said: ""This last minute statement by the FCA... will enable UK firms to deal with clients subject to the EU rules without having to require them to sign up to swap execution facilities in the U.S."" MARKET ACCESS Sterling extended gains versus the euro after news of the three-month grace period. It means that more swaps trading is likely to leave London for EU-based platforms such as Tradeweb from Monday.","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-backtracks-over-brexit-curbs-cross-border-swaps-trading-2020-12-31/
2020-12-31,Reuters,"Peruvian president 'deplores' two deaths in farm workers protest, vows to sanction police Peru's President Francisco Sagasti has vowed tough action against police after two people, including a teenager, were killed during protests by farm workers over a new controversial agrarian law. The two victims died on Wednesday after officers reportedly used live firearms against a protest blocking the main coastal road through La Libertad, a farming community 600 kilometres (370 miles) north of the capital Lima.  ""We deplore and reject what happened in La Libertad,"" ​​said President Francisco Sagasti on his Twitter account on Thursday. ""We condemn those who incite violence. We will sanction the police officers who violated the ban on the use of firearms.""     A hospital report said one, a 16-year-old boy, died from a gunshot injury. The local prosecutor said he had been taking part in the protest but his family said he was simply passing by. The second person's identity and their cause of death has not yet been confirmed.  A photograph widely published in local media showed a man identified by the interior ministry as a police officer pointing a pistol.  It sparked fresh calls for police reform in the wake of anti-government protests earlier this month in which at least two people were killed and 200 injured amid widespread allegations and reports of police violence.  Sagasti also called for fresh dialogue between political parties and the three branches of government on reform of Peru's key agricultural sector, saying the new law passed on Tuesday night  ""does not satisfy any of the parties involved.""  The new law increased the base salaries of farm workers that had been as low as as 39 soles ($11) daily by 30% but workers' groups say the salary and benefits provisions are still not enough. They also claim the law upholds what they say are unjustified benefits enjoyed by powerful agricultural conglomerates. ""We continue to be discriminated (with the new law) in terms of benefit payments,"" Juan Antonio Herrera, the national leader of the agricultural workers' union, told Reuters. ""In Peru, even those who sell candy pay taxes, why do large companies that have grown for 20 years continue to enjoy tax exemptions?""  Agricultural producers, on the other hand, have criticized the new law saying it would put jobs at risk in the sector.

Exports in the final month of 2020 grew 12.6% year-on-year, the sharpest growth since October 2018 when it grew 22.5%, government data showed on Friday. The rate of growth was sharply higher than forecast as analysts had expected a 5.6% jump from a year earlier, and was much faster than a 4.1% growth in November. ""Semiconductor exports were exceptionally strong, with 11 of 15 major export items posting growth ... sales of IT products boosted the overall growth,"" a trade ministry official told Reuters. South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade. Overseas sales of semiconductors surged 30% from a year earlier, marking the sharpest expansion since August 2018, towing the overall exports recovery. Other major items such as mobile devices, displays and computers also soared 39.8%, 28.0% and 14.7% year-on-year. By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 3.3% from a year ago, and those to the United States and European Union jumped 11.6% and 26.4%. Imports rose 1.8%, reversing a 1.9% decline in November and marking the best reading since April 2019. Reuters' poll had expected a 2.6% decline. Meanwhile, for the whole of 2020, South Korea's exports slid 5.4% as the coronavirus pandemic swept world trade, but that was much better than a 10.4% fall in 2019, the worst in a decade and the third-worst in the country's modern history.","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-exports-post-sharpest-expansion-26-months-dec-slide-54-yy-2020-2021-01-01/
2020-12-31,Reuters,"British family doctors criticise change of plan on vaccine boosters British doctors have said a government decision to delay giving a coronavirus vaccine booster shot to vulnerable patients who have already had a first dose will be distressing and disruptive, their trade union said on Thursday. The government said on Wednesday it wanted to give a first dose to as many people as possible before starting to administer boosters at 12 weeks, in an effort to provide more people with a degree of protection more quickly. But Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) committee for local family doctors, said it was ""grossly and patently unfair to tens of thousands of our most at-risk patients to now try to reschedule their appointments"". For the newly approved vaccine developed by Oxford University and made by AstraZeneca (AZN.L) being rolled out in Britain next week, the plan is consistent with a finding that waiting 12 weeks maximises protection against the virus.  But in the case of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N)(22UAy.DE) shot that is already being given, the manufacturer said the shot had not been evaluated on dosing schedules different from the recommended 21 days. The BMA said scores of doctors had told it that the new approach would distress vulnerable patients and create logistical problems for healthcare staff. ""The BMA believes these are patients that have already been promised ... that they will receive a second dose of Pfizer vaccination next week; they have given their consent to receive it and, quite rightly, are expecting to have it,"" the BMA said. More than 944,000 people had been given the Pfizer vaccine by Dec. 27, the health ministry said on Thursday.  The BMA said it would support any doctors who decided to honour existing booster appointments, and urged the government to provide a ""scientifically validated justification"" for its new approach. In a joint statement, the chief medical officers from across the United Kingdom said they recognise that the request to re-schedule appointments will be difficult and will distress patients who were looking forward to being fully immunised.","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-family-doctors-criticise-change-plan-vaccine-boosters-2020-12-31/

The change to ""for we are one and free"" took effect on Friday. ""We live in a timeless land of ancient First Nations peoples, and we draw together the stories of more than 300 national ancestries and language groups,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""And our anthem should reflect that. The changes we have made and we have announced today, I think, achieve that goal."" Australia has struggled for decades to reconcile with Aborigines, who arrived on the continent some 50,000 years before British colonists.  Each year Australians have a national holiday on Jan. 26, marking the date the “First Fleet” sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788, carrying mainly convicts and troops from Britain. Some indigenous people refer to Australia Day as “Invasion Day”.  There is now a renewed focus on Indigenous empowerment amid the Black Lives Matter movement. The idea to change the wording was floated in 2020 by New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian who had said the current wording ignored Australia’s ""proud First Nations culture"". The proposal was welcomed by several lawmakers, including  federal minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt as well as firebrand rightwing One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson. When asked if he would want to be the first person to sing the new national anthem, Morisson said: ""I think singing by prime ministers is the same as public exercise by prime ministers -- it is best done in private.""","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-changes-national-anthem-wording-reflect-indigenous-history-2021-01-01/

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hopes significant vaccination campaigns on the continent will begin in April, its head, John Nkengasong, told reporters. ""That's a long way to go given that this virus transmits very quickly,"" he said, adding that in Africa, ""the second wave is here with a vengeance"". Cases of the new coronavirus increased by nearly 19% since last week and deaths increased by 26%, according to Africa CDC data. Africa has recorded 2.7 million coronavirus infections and 64,000 deaths as of Thursday, it says.  South Africa, where a new variant of the virus has been detected, recorded 82,000 cases in the past week, he said. ""We cannot delay, we need those vaccines and need them now,"" Nkengasong said. The major blockers to vaccinations beginning in Africa are global availability of doses and financing, he said. Wealthy nations have acquired vaccines in excess of what they need, he said. ""We don't have to get into a moral crisis, where these things are stocked in the developed world and we in Africa are struggling to have,"" Nkengasong said.  The African Union is in talks with the European Union, Canada, and pharmaceutical companies to secure doses, he said, to secure vaccines in addition to what Africa has been promised by the World Health Organization’s COVAX programme.

2020-12-31,Reuters,"SolarWinds hackers accessed Microsoft source code, the company says The hacking group behind the SolarWinds (SWI.N) compromise was able to break into Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and access some of its source code, Microsoft said on Thursday, something experts said sent a worrying signal about the spies' ambition. Source code - the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system - is typically among a technology company's most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it.      It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft's source code repositories the hackers were able to access, but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.     Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds' software inside its network, but the source code disclosure - made in a blog post - is new.  Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working ""around the clock"" and that ""when there is actionable information to share, they have published and shared it."" The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed, compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified. Modifying source code - which Microsoft said the hackers did not do - could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products, which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services. ""The source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built,"" said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode, a source code protection company.  ""If you have the blueprint, it's far easier to engineer attacks."" Matt Tait, an independent cybersecurity researcher, agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products, but he also cautioned that elements of the company's source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code.

2020-12-31,Reuters,"GLOBAL MARKETS European shares end 2020 in a slump European shares fell on Thursday as lockdowns and rising COVID-19 cases overshadowed the optimism around the rollout of vaccines in the New Year, while the dollar fell to a two-and-a-half-year low.  Trading volumes were thin, with many traders away on New Year's Eve and major European markets closed. Where markets were open, they failed to follow their Asian peers higher. UK's FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 1.7% and France's CAC 40 (.FCHI) 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were 0.15% lower , pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street. The MSCI World Index (.MIWD00000PUS) was down on the day as gains in Asia gave way to the losses in Europe. The index is headed for a near 14% rise in 2020 after surging more than 60% from its March lows. Despite a stimulus-charged rebound since the pandemic-induced market slump in March, most European markets have underperformed the United States and Asia, where a series of record highs have been reached. The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX), which was closed on Thursday, recorded a 3.8% drop in 2020 as a rapid surge in coronavirus cases and worries about Brexit curbed improving sentiment. Still, despite the rising COVID-19 cases and increasing unemployment, investors were betting the rollout of vaccines in 2021 will unleash an economic rebound spurred by plentiful fiscal and monetary cash. ""We still see growth slowing around the turn of the year and the recovery will still face headwinds in the coming quarters, but 2021 is shaping up to be better still than our already strong global outlook—led by a stronger U.S.,"" JP Morgan economists said in a research note. Among the biggest developments in markets in 2020 has been the dramatic drop in the dollar. On Thursday, it hit its lowest since April 2018 and is now down 7.2% against a basket of currencies , its worst annual performance since 2017. The dollar's weakness, driven by bets that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates very low, has helped rival currencies.","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-4-pix-2020-12-31/

Hungary has participated in Russia's testing efforts and was an early recipient of small batches of Russia's Sputnik-V vaccine, raising alarm among European peers that it would bypass the European Union's approval mechanism. ""Russia has inadequate manufacturing capacity,"" Gergely Gulyas told broadcaster ATV in an interview, according to a transcript on ATV's web site.

Hungarian premier Viktor Orban has come under criticism during his decade-long rule for building ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, including massive joint projects, such as a new nuclear power plant. Orban has said Hungary would not rule out any avenue to secure any vaccine that it could, and Budapest has sent expert teams to Russia to observe manufacturing. It has also agreed to participate in its trials. Its government has not committed to subject the vaccines it uses to the European Medicines Agency for approval and has repeatedly said it would use its own experts for testing and approval, which is a temporary option for EU member states in an emergency situation.

The hikes come as drugmakers are reeling from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced doctor visits and demand for some drugs. They are also fighting new drug price cutting rules from the Trump administration, which would reduce the industry's profitability.  The companies kept their price increases at 10% or below, and the largest drug companies to raise prices so far, Pfizer and Sanofi, kept nearly all of their increases 5% or less, 3 Axis said. 3 Axis is a consulting firm that works with pharmacists groups, health plans and foundation on drug pricing and supply chain issues. GSK did raise prices on two vaccines - shingles vaccine Shingrix and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine Pediarix - by 7% and 8.6%, respectively, 3 Axis said.  Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc (TEVA.TA) hiked prices on 15 drugs, including Austedo, which treats rare neurological disorders, and asthma steroid Qvar, which together grossed more than $650 million in sales in 2019 and saw price hikes of between 5% and 6%. Teva hiked prices for some drugs, including muscle relaxant Amrix and narcolepsy treatment Nuvigil, as much as 9.4%.  More price hikes are expected to be announced on Friday and in early January. In 2020, drugmakers raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5 percent, on average, according to 3 Axis. Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected. The increases come as pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer are playing hero by developing vaccines for COVID-19 in record time. The hikes could help make up for lost revenue as doctors visits and new prescriptions plummeted during the global lockdown. Pfizer plans to raise prices on more than 60 drugs by between 0.5 % and 5%. Those include roughly 5% increases on some of its top sellers like rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz and cancer drugs Ibrance and Inlyta.

2020-12-31,Reuters,"GRAPHIC After golden year for precious metals, silver set to shine in 2021 After a spectacular year, precious metals are set for further gains in 2021, with silver tipped to outperform, but analysts are growing more cautious about the prospects for gold as the global economy recovers from the impact of the coronavirus. The pandemic triggered stockpiling by investors looking to protect their wealth. This, alongside supply deficits, pushed gold and palladium prices up by more than 20% this year, while silver rose 47%, and platinum 10%.    ""We are going to see new record highs for gold and palladium (in 2021),"" said Philip Newman at consultants Metals Focus. ""But silver will see the chunkiest gains,"" he said.  Traditionally seen as a safe place to store money, gold began to rise as economic growth slowed in 2019, but the pandemic accelerated the rally and in August prices hit a record high of $2,072.50. While demand for physical gold was hammered as the virus forced shutdowns, investment demand surged as reflected in the holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, which recorded its biggest yearly gain since 2009 at about 30%. GOL/ETFGOL/AS Prices then dipped to around $1,900 as investors stopped buying and vaccines were deployed against the virus, encouraging investment in assets that perform well during periods of economic growth. Huge government debt, negative real returns on bonds and threats of inflation and market turbulence, all of which support gold, will persist in 2021, said Ross Norman, an independent analyst. Gold could rise another 20% next year, he said. A safe-haven asset like gold, but also an industrial metal used in products including solar panels, silver climbed from $18 an ounce in January to almost $30 in August before slipping to around $25. Analysts say its dual role and its greater volatility mean it could fare better than gold as economic growth picks up, and as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's push into clean energy prompts more usage.","Dec 31, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/graphic-after-golden-year-precious-metals-silver-set-shine-2021-2020-12-31/

Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court said it was reasonable to infer from the plaintiffs' claims that the December 2019 merger was ""not entirely fair,"" and that Redstone used it ""to consolidate her control of Viacom and CBS at the expense of the Viacom minority stockholders.""

In his 76-page decision, Slights let the shareholders pursue breach of fiduciary duty claims against Redstone, National Amusements and Viacom directors who negotiated the merger. He dismissed the same claim against ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish, finding no evidence of wrongdoing and saying it appeared Bakish ""deliberately chose not to flaunt his power as chief executive.""

2020-12-30,Reuters,"Currency markets stay 'risk-on' as dollar hits lowest since 2018 The dollar slid to its lowest in more than two years on Wednesday and riskier currencies gained, as investors looked past rising COVID-19 infections and the latest delay in U.S. fiscal stimulus talks to bet on an economic recovery in 2021. Lockdown measures in England will be extended, and U.S. President-elect Joe Biden warned that it could take years for most Americans to be vaccinated against COVID-19 at current rates.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked a vote on increasing COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000, adding another delay to fractious negotiations over fiscal stimulus.  But market sentiment was upbeat as investors remained optimistic that a stimulus deal will be eventually reached and that COVID-19 vaccines will facilitate a global economic recovery, lessening demand for the safe-haven dollar. The latest setback ""doesn’t really matter too much for investors, as they have been over the moon on the back of news that there is still plenty of fiscal support for the U.S. economy,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said in a note. Analysts expect the dollar to weaken further in 2021 as U.S. President-elect Biden is expected to push for even more measures to support the U.S. economy. The ""risk-on"" moves in currency markets saw major currencies reach record levels in the Asian session on Wednesday, ease off as European markets opened, then hit new records as the European session continued.

At a virtual special stockholder meeting, more than 99% of votes cast were in favor of the deal.  Billionaire Bernard Arnault-led LVMH made the first offer late last year, but as the luxury industry slipped into a turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic the company backed out from its promise to close the deal. LVMH also cited French political intervention to delay completing the acquisition until Jan. 6, pushing Tiffany into a legal battle in September to force LVMH to honor the deal. Tiffany had earlier said its sales were improving, citing demand recovery in the United States ahead of the holiday season and China, one of its biggest markets.  LVMH then renegotiated the deal price, lowering it by $425 million. The deal, now cleared by regulators, is expected to close in early 2021.  As agreed in October, LVMH will pay $131.5 per share, down from $135 in the original deal signed late last year.

AstraZeneca said the approval by the National Administrator for Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT) made Argentina ""one of the first countries in the world to authorize"" the drug, after the UK regulator gave the green light for its widespread roll-out earlier on Wednesday. The company said the approval was for the vaccine to be administered to people over the age of 18 in two doses between four and 12 weeks apart, as per the UK approval.  Argentina has a contract to buy 22.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which the company said would all be delivered in 2021. Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez said in August that Argentina and Mexico would also work together to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine for most of Latin America.     Agustín Lamas, President of AstraZeneca in Latin America's Southern Cone, said: ""A new stage in this process begins, we feel hopeful and confident in achieving what we set out to do from the beginning: broad and equitable access, without profit for the duration of the pandemic.""  The Argentine regulator said in a statement that it had judged the vaccine's emergency roll-out to present ""an acceptable benefit-risk balance.""  Argentina on Christmas Eve began vaccinating health workers using 300,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.      Argentina is preparing for a potential second wave facing other countries in the region including Chile, Mexico and Brazil. It has so far registered 1,602,163 cases of COVID-19 and 43,018 deaths.

2020-12-30,Reuters,"'Well into spring' before Italy sees significant impact of COVID vaccine, PM says Vaccines will start to have a clear impact on the spread of the coronavirus in Italy ""well into spring"" when 10-15 million people will have been inoculated, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday. Italy, the first Western country to be hit hard by the pandemic, has reported more than 73,000 COVID-related deaths since discovering its outbreak late in February, the highest death toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. Italy kicked off its vaccination drive on Sunday with the first shots produced by Pfizer-BioNTech. The campaign will initially target health workers and the elderly, followed by people with chronic diseases. ""It will be well into spring when we see a first significant impact,"" Conte told reporters at the prime minister's traditional end-year news conference. But he ruled out making the shots obligatory, contradicting some government members who had said this could be an option if insufficient numbers of people volunteer. ""I am asking for a collective effort, let's put aside ideology or emotions. Let's vaccinate,"" Conte said. The EU is due to receive its first 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by Jan. 1, with distribution of 200 million doses across its 27 member countries to be completed by September. Asked why Italy did not follow Germany's example by procuring vaccine supply over and above its EU allotment, Conte said this was forbidden under the terms of the agreement overseen by the European Commission. There have been complaints in Italy among commentators and the political opposition that Germany - the EU's largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots. Most of the three-hour news conference was devoted to tensions in Conte's ruling coalition in which former prime minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the tiny centrist party Italia Viva, constantly threatens to bring down the government.","Dec 30, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/well-into-spring-before-italy-sees-significant-impact-covid-vaccine-pm-says-2020-12-30/
2020-12-30,Reuters,"Cyber attack on U.S. government may have started earlier than initially thought -U.S. senator The unprecedented cyber attack on U.S. government agencies reported this month may have started earlier than last spring as previously believed, a U.S. senator involved in cybersecurity said on Wednesday. U.S. investigators originally thought that the attack on government agencies and private industry targets began in March or April, including breaches of Treasury, State, Commerce and Energy Departments. State-backed Russian hackers were identified as the suspects. Russia has denied involvement. ""The initial burrowing in may have started earlier,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who serves as Vice-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee told Reuters in an interview. Warner said extensive investigations of the hack were active but that so far the U.S. government does not have hard evidence that classified government secrets were compromised by the hackers.     Warner said gaps in U.S. and international law make it difficult to track and crack down on large scale hacks and that the United States and its allies must act to tighten controls.  ""We still don’t have for the private sector, or for that matter the public sector, any mandatory reporting"" on major hacking incidents, Warner said. ""The amount of time it’s taking to assess the (latest) attack, its taking longer than we would like to take,"" he added. Warner said the lack of U.S. laws and policy to counter such major hacks is the product of a ""lack of policy that precedes (the administration of President Donald) Trump."" During the administration of President Barack Obama, he said, people in both government and private sector ""pushed back ferociously"" at talk of stepping up cyberspace legal controls. The latest hacking campaign, disclosed by U.S. officials in mid December, entered U.S. government and private systems by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by Texas-based software company SolarWinds (SWI.N), which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a “supply chain attack” - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties. Although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. government sources have said Russia is the principal suspect in the attack, Trump himself has questioned their responsibility and suggested China might be behind the attack. ""There has been obviously  a reluctance out of this White House to call out Russia repeatedly,"" Warner said. ""I don’t believe that is a problem of the intelligence community. I think that is a problem of the White House.""","Dec 30, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cyber-attack-us-government-may-have-started-earlier-than-initially-thought-us-2020-12-31/

Sources earlier told Reuters the CDSCO was likely to approve the vaccine this week after its local manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), submitted additional trial data.

2020-12-30,Reuters,"Soccer-Mexico's Santos Laguna sue Disney over broadcast rights Mexican soccer club Santos Laguna are suing U.S.-based global entertainment giant Walt Disney Company, alleging millions of dollars in damages due to contractual violations stemming from Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox last year. The club filed suit in a California court this week, claiming Disney violated the terms of a five-year agreement signed in 2017 that set out lucrative broadcast rights for their home games, plus other promotional services. They argue the violations could leave the club without a viable broadcast partner to televise their games. Santos Laguna assert the original deal they signed with what was then known as FSLA Holdings, formerly a unit of Fox, was worth some $106 million, covering broadcast rights of games both in Mexico and internationally beginning in the 2019/2020 season. But after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox, Disney agreed to divest itself from FSLA, now known as TFCF Holdings.  The lawsuit alleges that in a related deal with Mexican regulators, Disney agreed that sports broadcaster ESPN, which is majority owned by Disney, would not try to buy up its competitor to ease regulatory approval for the acquisition in Mexico. In Mexico, ESPN and Fox Sports channels are the two major broadcasters for professional soccer games. ""We believe the claims are utterly without merit and will defend against them vigorously,"" a Disney spokesman said. With the future of TFCF in limbo, Santos say they will likely be denied license fees and other promotional considerations that they believe they are entitled to under the original contract. That required FSLA to pay Santos at least $72.5 million for the right to broadcast home games, plus a marketing and promotion plan worth $33 million, the lawsuit said.","Dec 30, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/soccer-mexicos-santos-laguna-sue-disney-over-broadcast-rights-2020-12-31/
2020-12-30,Reuters,"Waiting for mass vaccines, California cafe will 'have to hang on' The months leading up to widespread COVID-19 vaccinations will be difficult for Farley's East, a cafe in Oakland, and other small businesses in California slammed by new state restrictions to fight record numbers of cases, pushing back any prospects for office workers returning to downtown buildings. With vaccine shipments reaching local hospitals this month and a new round of government aid on offer in a $892 billion relief package signed into law Sunday, co-owner Chris Hillyard says he's more hopeful than he has been in a while. ""It felt like a 100 years, being in this lockdown,"" Hillyard said. ""I am not looking forward to the winter, but I'm also feeling like we are going to get through this, at this point."" The pandemic has hit California hard. Early and long-lasting stay-at-home orders may have saved lives in the state, which has had fewer deaths per capita than all but 10 other states. Still, the current surge is filling hospital beds and straining resources.  The state's economy is reeling as well, its 8.2% unemployment rate the nation's sixth-highest. In November, California had 21.4% fewer restaurant employees than it had a year earlier, a loss of 315,600 jobs in the sector, far more than in any other state. Farley's shut for about six weeks at the start of the crisis, then reopened and rehired 15 of its 40 staff in late April thanks to a government grant that covered payroll until mid-summer. After the grant was spent, Hillyard and his wife Amy kept things going with funding from Washington-based charity World Central Kitchen, which contracts with more than 100 Oakland restaurants to fix meals that are distributed to people in the community. In recent weeks, Farley's built a brisk holiday season business in gift boxes of coffees, teas and books. But the season ends soon, and World Central Kitchen plans to wind down its Oakland operations next month, after injecting about $22.5 million into the community through its meals program. Oakland's downtown remains nearly empty of the workers who were once Farley's main customers and sales are about 30% of pre-crisis levels, Hillyard says.  That's not enough to pay the bills, especially with colder, rainier months ahead and the promise of extended stay-at-home orders likely to keep even more customers away.

Near-term expectations of bigger stimulus checks dimmed after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a quick vote to back President Donald Trump's call to increase COVID-19 relief checks to $2,000 from $600 already signed into law. McConnell introduced a bill that tied the increased $2,000 stimulus checks with the removal of protections for social media companies and a study on election security.  ""Something's better than nothing but there's a lot of politics involved. The market is anticipating something, whether $600 or $2,000 part of that is baked into the cake,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts.   ""The markets are saying 'what have you done for me lately?' and people are going to be focusing on what's going to happen if we see more and more restrictions due to the pandemic.""  Investors are also eyeing the Georgia run-off election on January 5, which could lead to Democratic control of the Senate, and upend the market view of political gridlock.  Optimism over vaccine rollouts was boosted after Britain approved the emergency use of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and Oxford University's COVID-19 vaccine, which will start being administered on Monday.  But that was tempered somewhat by the first known U.S. case of a highly infectious coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that was now detected in Colorado.

Maati Monjib, a university historian who writes frequent newspaper editorials, has denied the accusations. His arrest at a restaurant on Tuesday followed the jailing or detention of several other dissident journalists in recent months.  The prosecutor's office said in October it was investigating Monjib on suspicion of money laundering.  Monjib has often denied wrongdoing in posts on his Facebook account and said he had been summoned several times by police to answer charges relating to alleged laundering of foreign funds.  At a hearing on Tuesday, a judge ordered he be kept behind bars during the investigation, the prosecutor's office said.  ""The Moroccan government appears to be banking on the world failing to notice its continued harassment of journalists over a holiday week,"" said Justin Shilad from the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international rights group.  The government has denied waging a campaign against free speech and has said the police and courts are implementing national laws.

Raissouni's niece, journalist Hajar Raissouni, was last year charged with having premarital sex and having an illegal abortion in another case that campaigners saw as an attempt to target dissent.

2020-12-30,Reuters,"U.S. may expand required COVID-19 testing to more international passengers The U.S. government may expand coronavirus testing requirements for international air travelers beyond Britain as early as next week, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other U.S. agencies held a lengthy call with U.S. airlines Wednesday that discussed expanding COVID-19 test requirements to travelers arriving from other countries, sources briefed on the call said. The U.S. government on Monday began requiring all airline passengers arriving from Britain - including U.S. citizens - to test negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of departure. The CDC said in a statement that ""efforts are currently ongoing in the U.S. to assess the risk reduction associated with testing and other recommended preventative measures, determine what a feasible testing regime for air travel may look like, and gain some level of agreement on standards for a harmonized approach to testing for international air travel."" The CDC expansion could eventually cover all U.S.-bound international air arrivals, officials said. On Wednesday, Canada said it will soon require that air travelers test negative for COVID-19 before arrival.      Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. airlines, said Wednesday it has ""been advocating for the federal government to set a national standard on testing in order to lift travel restrictions."" The group added it believes ""testing can be used to safely reopen borders."" A U.S. Transportation Department spokesman confirmed the call with airlines took place. Airlines told government agencies on Wednesday any new testing requirements should be phased in by country and it must be determined if there is enough testing capacity and a willingness to allocate those tests to facilitate international travel before expanding requirements, the sources said. Officials said the White House could make a decision as early as next week on adding new countries to the testing requirements but it is not clear when those new requirements would take effect. On Tuesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir said coronavirus testing for UK travelers should probably be extended to other countries.","Dec 30, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-may-expand-required-covid-19-testing-more-international-passengers-2020-12-30/

2020-12-29,Reuters,"GLOBAL MARKETS Asian shares pause recent rally, euro near 2-1/2-year high Asian shares retreated on Wednesday as investors cashed in on a recent rally, while the euro flirted with highs not seen in more than 2-1/2 years on as hopes of a gradual global economic recovery supported demand for riskier currencies. Australian shares (.AXJO) lost 0.79% while Japan's Nikkei share average (.N225) lost 0.03% after jumping to a 30-year high on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures (.HSI) were up 0.11%, however, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500  were little changed. Shares on Wall Street had pulled back from record highs overnight as uncertainty about whether the U.S. Senate would authorize additional stimulus checks gave investors a reason to take profits. .N The U.S. Senate's vote on the additional checks appeared to be delayed by early Wednesday morning Asia time, while news that the United States has detected its first-known case of a highly infectious coronavirus variant could give investors more reason to cash in gains.  But in a sign that markets are not avoiding risky assets across the board, the U.S. dollar struggled as investors favoured riskier currencies. The euro  was steady at $1.2255, after climbing overnight to a high of $1.2275, a level last seen in April 2018. Traders said the common currency appeared well-supported at $1.2200 and $1.2165. ""The start of COVID‑19 immunization campaigns in several countries as well as additional U.S. fiscal support reduce downside risk to the global economy and bode well for general financial market sentiment,"" analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. The Australian dollar  was steady at $0.7609, within sight of a 2-1/2-year high of $0.7639, while sterling  traded sideways at $1.3500. The Japanese yen  was little changed at 103.55, with some traders predicting it will be pinned between the 103.00-104.00 range for now. Investors are betting that the dollar is entering a downtrend in the foreseeable future as a recovery in the global economy next year leads them to shun so-called ""safe-haven"" assets such as the greenback.","Dec 29, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/global-markets-wrapup-1-2020-12-30/
2020-12-29,Reuters,"U.S., EU criticise China for jailing citizen-journalist who reported on COVID-19 The European Union and United States on Tuesday criticised the jailing of a citizen-journalist in China who reported on the early outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic from Wuhan. A Chinese court handed down a four-year jail term on Monday to Zhang Zhan, who reported at the peak of the crisis in the city where the coronavirus first emerged. Her lawyer said Zhang was jailed on the grounds of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"".  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that he strongly condemned Zhang's conviction and called for her immediate and unconditional release, accusing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of restricting and manipulating information about the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. ""Her hasty trial, to which foreign observers were denied access, shows how fearful the CCP is of Chinese citizens who speak the truth,"" Pompeo said, adding that the United States would always support the right of Chinese citizens to express themselves freely. U.S.-China relations have plunged to their worst level in decades as the world's top two economies spar over issues ranging from the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing's national security law for Hong Kong, trade and espionage. The EU also called for Zhang's immediate release, as well as for freedom for jailed human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng, and several other detained and convicted human rights defenders and individuals who engaged in reporting in the public interest. ""According to credible sources, Ms Zhang has been subject to torture and ill-treatment during her detention and her health condition has seriously deteriorated,"" an external affairs spokesman for the 27-nation EU said in a statement.  Separately, the EU called on China to ""guarantee procedural fairness and due process of law"" for 10 Hong Kong activists on trial in China after being caught at sea and accused of trying to flee to Taiwan.  In a statement it called for the immediate release of the group and their swift return to Hong Kong from Shenzhen, where they went on trial on Dec. 28 in a closed court and without appointed lawyers of their choice.  The EU criticism over the cases comes a day before EU and Chinese leaders are expected to clinch a deal to give European companies better access to the Chinese market.

2020-12-29,Reuters,"UK house prices rise by most in six years - Nationwide British house prices rose faster than expected in December to record their biggest annual increase in six years, as tax incentives and COVID-driven appetite for larger homes continued to boost demand, mortgage lender Nationwide said. House prices rose by 0.8% in December alone, barely slowing from the 0.9% recorded in November, and were 7.3% higher than a year earlier, well above forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 6.7% rise. After a collapse in house purchases during the first months of lockdown, there has been a surge in demand to move house, driven in part by a temporary exemption of property purchase taxes which will expire at the end of March. Nationwide said the strength of the housing market contrasted with weakness in some other parts of the economy - especially those exposed to renewed COVID-19 restrictions - and said the outlook for prices in 2021 was highly uncertain. ""Housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labour market weakens as most analysts expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March,"" Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said. So far furlough payments and similar support for the self-employed had limited the impact of a historic 26% fall in economic output on the housing market, against most economists' earlier expectations, he added. Demand for detached homes had risen most, with an average rise of just over 8% in the past 12 months, while prices for flats had risen by 4%.

Experts say it is possible to obtain six doses from each vial, more than the five approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he had raised the matter with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with a view to seeking EMA clearance for the extra shot as soon as possible. The vaccine, made by Pfizer of the United States and the German biotech startup BioNTech, is the only one to win EU approval so far, and is already being administered.  But supplies are tight and rising coronavirus infections are stretching hospitals to the limit. BioNTech said each vial was guaranteed to yield five doses, but that it was possible, with the right needle and syringe, to extract a sixth. ""We are in discussions with regulatory authorities whether and how the sixth dose, as well as the required needles or syringes for such a low-dead-volume system, could be made available,"" a BioNTech spokesperson said. Italian regulators have already approved the drawing of six doses, overriding EMA guidance for the EU as a whole. Similar approvals have been issued by regulators in the United States, Britain, Switzerland and Israel - which all made an earlier start to their vaccination campaigns.

Scientists say the new variant can spread more rapidly. It was found in England in mid December and led to other countries imposing travel restrictions to the United Kingdom. Several other countries have reported variants.  Under the study, researchers compared 1,769 people infected with the new variant with 1,769 who had what they described as ""wild-type"" virus. The two groups were matched 1:1 on the basis of age, sex, area of residence and time of testing. Of the 42 people who were admitted to hospital, 16 were infected with the new variant while 26 cases had wild type infection, according to the study. In terms of fatality, there were 12 deaths in variant cases compared to 10 deaths in wild-type cases. ""Preliminary results from the cohort study found no statistically significant difference in hospitalisation and 28-day case fatality between cases with the variant and wild-type comparator cases,"" the study said. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of reinfection with the new variant as compared with the other variants, it said. The study, however, added that the ""secondary attack rate"", or the proportion of contacts of confirmed cases that develop  disease themselves, was higher in people infected with the new variant. Earlier on Tuesday a leading epidemiologist who advises the government, Andrew Hayward, warned that Britain was heading for ""catastrophe"" over the coming weeks if it did not take tougher action against the more infectious variant of the disease.

The ownership change caps a battle between China's Fortune Fountain Capital, a wealth management firm that bought Baccarat in 2017, and its creditors, with which it came into conflict and which have taken over the crystal glassware maker following a debt-for-equity swap.  Baccarat declined to comment, while Fortune Fountain could not immediately be reached. Founded in 1764, Baccarat, which has made chandeliers and tableware including for royalty, is one of several French luxury names to have attracted Chinese investors keen to capitalise on demand in China for high-end brands and goods.

2020-12-29,Reuters,"US STOCKS Wall St slips from record levels, additional stimulus uncertain U.S. stocks fell from record highs on Tuesday in choppy trading, as investors worried about the path of reopening the economy and whether the Senate would approve additional pandemic aid checks.    U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would address this week President Donald Trump's call for an increase in stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000, after blocking an immediate consideration of the measure on Tuesday. Final passage of the proposal would require 60 votes and the backing of a dozen Republicans. McConnell's comment comes a day after Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the move to bump up direct payments.  ""On a motion like that they are going to follow the leader,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.   Massocca said he thought McConnell would ""put something unappetizing in there and the whole thing is going to fall apart, I don’t think the $2,000 is going to happen.""  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 101.76 points, or 0.33%, to 30,302.21, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 9.84 points, or 0.26%, to 3,725.52 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 57.54 points, or 0.45%, to 12,841.89. Volumes are expected to be light in the holiday-shortened week, which could lead to volatility. Wall Street's three main indexes opened at new highs for a second straight session after Trump signed a $2.3 trillion fiscal bill that restored jobless benefits and averted a federal government shutdown. Meanwhile, more than 2 million Americans have been inoculated, helping investors looked past a surge in infections that topped 19 million, with California, a major U.S. virus hot spot, likely to extend strict stay-at-home orders.  But a sharp drop in small cap stocks could be a reflection of the concern surrounding the surge in infections leading to a slower than hoped for reopening, according to Massocca. The Russell 2000 small cap index was off 2.23%, on pace for its biggest daily percentage drop in two months.

Sarah Lim, a senior staff nurse at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, was the first of more than 30 staff at the centre who are being vaccinated on Wednesday, the health ministry said. They will return for the second dose of the vaccine on Jan. 20. ""I feel very grateful and thankful for being the first to be vaccinated in Singapore,"" said Lim, who helps screen suspected COVID-19 cases. In recorded remarks provided by the health ministry, she said she hoped to encourage others to get vaccinated.      Singapore is the first country in Asia to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) COVID-19 vaccine. It has also signed advance purchase agreements and made early down payments on several other vaccine candidates, including those being developed by Moderna (MRNA.O) and Sinovac (SVA.O).  It expects to have enough vaccine doses for all 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021. Singapore acted swiftly after the first cases of the virus were reported and although it was blindsided by tens of thousands of cases in migrant workers dormitories, it has reported just a handful of new cases over the last two months. The country has one of the world's lowest COVID-19 fatality rates; only 29 people have died of the virus. To show the vaccine is safe, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 68, said he and his colleagues would be among the early recipients of the shots. They will be free and voluntary, but the government is encouraging all medically eligible residents to take them. China is inoculating specific groups of people considered at high risk of infection, such as medical workers and border inspectors, under an emergency use programme started in July. Its vaccines are still in late-stage clinical trials.  In Japan and South Korea, the U.S military has begun its first wave of COVID-19 vaccinations, prioritising frontline medical workers.

He said that argument appeared ""puzzling, if not disingenuous,"" saying Cupertino, California-based Apple did not impose a reporting requirement under its own Bug Bounty Program.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.46%. Australian stocks (.AXJO) rose 0.55%. Japan's Nikkei (.N225) leapt 1.63% to its highest since August 1990, while shares in China (.CSI300) rose 0.1%.  Futures for the S&P 500  added 0.32%. The dollar nursed losses against major currencies and Treasury yields rose after U.S. President Donald Trump's approval of a stimulus package related to the coronavirus outbreak increased risk appetite. The positive mood also helped oil futures rise during Asian trading in hopes for an acceleration in economic activity. The U.S. House of Representatives had voted earlier to increase stimulus payments to qualified Americans to $2,000 from $600, sending the measure on to the Senate for a vote.  While it is not clear how the measure will fare in the Senate, President Donald Trump's signing on Sunday of a $2.3 trillion pandemic bill, which included the $600 payments, had sent shares on Wall Street to record highs overnight as it increased optimism about an economic recovery. .N ""With the Brexit ... and the U.S. stimulus deal now in the rear-view mirror, there is a sense of relief that we have avoided the respective worst-case scenarios,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axi, a broker.

2020-12-28,Reuters,"Brazil to seek regulatory approval for AstraZeneca vaccine on Jan. 15 Brazil's Fiocruz biomedical institute will seek approval for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccine against COVID-19 with federal health regulator Anvisa on Jan. 15, one of the center's senior officials said on Monday. The Jan. 15 date brings a measure of clarity to Brazil's vaccine rollout, which critics have blasted for falling behind smaller and poorer peers in Latin America. The AstraZeneca vaccine represents the Brazilian government's main bet to help end the world's second-most deadly coronavirus outbreak, after the United States. ""The final submission of this process, this last milestone, will be on Jan. 15,"" Marco Krieger, vice president of health production and innovation at the Rio de Janeiro-based Fiocruz institute, told Reuters. Once seen as a front-runner in the development of a coronavirus vaccine, the British team has been overtaken by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE), whose shots are already being used in Britain and the United States. Confusion has arisen over the best dosage. Data published earlier from the British team's Phase 3 trials showed efficacy was 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but a more robust 90% for a sub-group given first a half, then a full dose. Krieger said Fiocruz would apply to Anvisa with a two-dose regimen, which, despite being less effective, was more widely tested, including in Brazil. He said Fiocruz would be applying for a full approval with Anvisa, rather than an emergency use application. Pfizer, which is in talks to sell its vaccine to Brazil's federal government, has said the emergency use application is onerous. Krieger said the institute would start filling and finishing 1 million doses per week in January, then ramp up to 3 million weekly doses in early February. Fiocruz is licensed to receive supplies from AstraZeneca and eventually produce the vaccine locally. Brazil's federal government, which has ordered the AstraZeneca vaccine, expects to receive 100 million doses in the first half of 2021. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, one of the world's most prominent coronavirus skeptics, said over the weekend he was not worried about criticism over the speed of Brazil's vaccine rollout, saying he felt no pressure.

The total figure, at 241,193 more deaths in April-November 2020 than during the same period the previous year, is significantly higher than the preliminary pandemic death toll of 55,265 so far, reported on a cumulative daily basis by the government's coronavirus crisis centre. This figure includes deaths recorded in December.  Though death tolls fluctuate year-to-year, tallies of what are referred to as excess deaths can illustrate the impact of the pandemic by including cases where the novel coronavirus was not a confirmed cause of death, as well as deaths from other causes that could be linked to the fact that national medical systems are over-stretched. Rosstat data, tallied by Reuters, showed that less than half the total number of such excess deaths - at 116,030 since the start of the pandemic in Russia in April - can be attributed directly to the coronavirus.  This is still more than double the preliminary death toll figure reported on a daily, cumulative basis by the Russian government coronavirus crisis centre, which is overseen by the health ministry and the consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. It stands at 55,265 so far, and includes deaths reported in December.  Rosstat shared new data on Monday about the total number of deaths reported in Russia in November.

Reported deaths fell 17% in the week ended Dec. 27 and new cases fell 16%, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports, the first declines in both figures since the week after the Thanksgiving holiday in late November. Weekly cases and deaths have otherwise been rising since early October. (For a state-by-state interactive, open https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR in an external browser) According to The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the pandemic, holiday reporting gaps and backlogs ""will obscure the realities of the country's many outbreaks."" Hospitals, which remain open, may provide the most accurate data for last week. More than 118,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on Dec. 27, up 4.5% from the previous Sunday, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project.

Idaho had the highest positive test rate in the country at 52.8% followed by Iowa at 49.9%.

2020-12-25,Reuters,"Japan official, calling Taiwan 'red line,' urges Biden to 'be strong' A top Japanese defence official on Friday urged U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to ""be strong"" in supporting Taiwan in the face of an aggressive China, calling the island's safety a ""red line."" ""We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan,"" State Minister of Defense Yasuhide Nakayama told Reuters. In an interview, Nakayama, Japan's deputy defence minister, urged Biden to take a similar line on Taiwan as outgoing President Donald Trump, who has significantly boosted military sales to the Chinese-claimed island and increased engagement. Japan's engagement with Taiwan has also flourished in recent years on a largely non-governmental basis. Tokyo maintains a ""one China"" policy, delicately balancing its relationships with neighbouring giant China and its longtime military ally in Washington. Japan shares strategic interests with Taiwan, which sits in sea lanes through which much of Japan's energy supplies and trade flow. ""So far, I haven't yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance,"" Nakayama said. During the presidential campaign, Biden called for strengthening ties with Taiwan and other ""like-minded democracies."" Decades ago as senator, Biden questioned whether the United States had an ""obligation"" to defend Taiwan. But many in his foreign policy circles acknowledge that U.S. imperatives have changed as a rising, authoritarian China has become more assertive and sought to shape global institutions. An official in Biden's transition team said the president-elect believes U.S. support for Taiwan ""must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan."" ""Once in office, he will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,"" the official said.","Dec 25, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-official-calling-taiwan-red-line-urges-biden-be-strong-2020-12-25/

Davis converted 10 of 16 shots and 3 of 5 3-point attempts. LeBron James had 22 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds while Montrezl Harrell contributed 22 points and seven rebounds for the Lakers. James passed Oscar Robertson (377 points) for second place in total points scored on Christmas Day. James has 383 points in 15 games, trailing only late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, who compiled 395 points in 16 Christmas Day games. James also tied former teammate Dwyane Wade for career Christmas wins at 10. Dennis Schroder scored 18 points on 7-of-11 shooting and contributed six assists, and Kyle Kuzma had 13 points and six rebounds for Los Angeles. Luka Doncic had 27 points and seven assists for Dallas. Six Mavericks scored in double figures, including Josh Richardson (17 points), Trey Burke (17), Dwight Powell (11), Dorian Finney-Smith (10) and Tim Hardaway Jr. (10). The Lakers seized command in the third quarter. They went up 80-63 on a James 3-pointer less than three minutes into the quarter. Los Angeles owned a 99-85 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Dallas sliced the gap to 106-97 after a 3-pointer by Richardson with 7:59 remaining but got no closer as Los Angeles pulled away. A 3-pointer by Davis gave the Lakers a 54-41 advantage, their biggest lead in the first half, with 5:25 left in the second quarter. But the Mavericks rallied, using a 9-1 surge to cut the deficit to 55-50 almost two minutes later. The Lakers pushed the margin to 69-57 on a 3-pointer by Kuzma to end the first half. Los Angeles outshot Dallas 56 percent to 49.4 percent for the game and outrebounded the Mavericks 53-27.

2020-12-25,Reuters,"In Christmas message curbed by Covid, pope calls on nations to share vaccines Pope Francis in his Christmas message on Friday said political and business leaders must not allow market forces and patent laws to take priority over making Covid 19 vaccines available to all, condemning nationalism and ""the virus of radical individualism"".     In a sign of the times, Francis delivered his traditional ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message virtually from a lectern inside the Vatican instead of from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica before tens of thousands. The pandemic and its social and economic effects dominated the message, in which Francis called for global unity and help for nations suffering from conflicts and humanitarian crises. ""At this moment in history, marked by the ecological crisis and grave economic and social imbalances only worsened by the coronavirus pandemic, it is all the more important for us to acknowledge one another as brothers and sisters,"" he said. Stressing that health is an international issue, he appeared to criticise so-called 'vaccine nationalism', which U.N. officials fear will worsen the pandemic if poor nations receive the vaccine last. ""I beg everyone, heads of state, companies and international organisations to promote cooperation and not competition, to find a solution for everyone - vaccines for all - especially for the most vulnerable and needy in all areas of the planet,"" he said. ""The most vulnerable and needy must be first,"" he said, in the Vatican's Hall of the Benedictions, with only about 50 Vatican staff wearing masks sitting along the long walls. ""RADICAL INDIVIDUALISM"" ""We can't put ourselves before others, putting market forces and patent laws before the laws of love and the health of humanity,"" he said. ""We cannot let closed nationalisms block us from living like the true human family that we are.""

President Vladimir Putin has touted the Arctic as a vital region for Russian interests as climate change makes it more accessible, presiding over a buildup of military infrastructure and pushing to increase cargo volumes shipped via the Northern Sea Route across its northern flank. The Central Scientific-Research Institute for Precision Machine Engineering, that makes weapons for Russia's military, said it had restored testing chambers to simulate extreme conditions. The chambers were closed after the Soviet breakup in 1991. Simulated conditions include extreme heat, cold and wet weather.  Maintenance funding for the testing chambers dried up in the early 1990s and they had fallen into a state of disrepair, it said.

2020-12-24,Reuters,"GLOBAL MARKETS Brexit deal anticipation fuels stocks and sterling Stocks rallied and the British pound gained on Thursday as Britain and the European Union closed in on a free trade deal and investors wagered on a global economic recovery.  Britain and the EU were hammering out the final details of a narrow post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday with an announcement expected soon, adding to an optimistic mood in the final trading session before the Christmas break. While a last-minute deal has long been expected, finally removing the possibility of a no-deal outcome 4-1/2 years after Britain voted to leave the trading bloc will come as a relief to markets.  The FTSE 100's(.FTSE)initial gains fizzled but the more domestically-focused British mid-cap FTSE 250 index (.FTMC) hit its highest levels since February, and UK small caps (.FTSC) a record level. The STOXX 50  added 0.1% while the MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.15% after gains in Asia. The Brexit trade deal adds to an end-of-year bullish mood in markets, where investors have looked beyond a spike in new COVID-19 cases globally and rising unemployment to the hope that vaccines and more fiscal spending will help spur an economic recovery in 2021.  High on record sums of central bank stimulus, investors have pushed stock markets to new peaks. Mizuho analysts dubbed it the ""mistletoe effect"", whereby anticipation of a trade accord meant that ""despite being subject to the approval of PM Johnson and EU governments the outline deal was enough"" to stoke a rally in markets.  Sterling added another 0.6% to $1.3586 , close to its highest level in two years. Still, analysts say the pound's 5% rally since early November means much of the Brexit relief has been priced in to the currency. ""What was billed as an oven ready deal has taken a nearly a year to defrost, but the fact it now seems so much more palatable for both sides is providing some much needed Christmas cheer for investors,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.","Dec 24, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-6-pix-2020-12-24/

It is usually held in the main section of the basilica and attended by up to 10,000 people, including the diplomatic corps representing nearly 200 countries. Everyone except the pope and the small choir wore a mask during the Mass, which began two hours earlier than usual so that even the limited number of people who attended could return home by a 10 p.m. curfew. ""The Son of God was born an outcast, in order to tell us that every outcast is a child of God,"" Francis said in his homily. Francis said Christmas should make everyone reflect on ""our injustice towards so many of our brothers and sisters"" instead of pursuing ""our endless desire for possessions"" and ephemeral pleasures.

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 1,241 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Thursday, the highest daily count recorded.  Daily numbers have been hovering at record levels over the past few weeks, around 1,000, but the government resisted calls for imposing the toughest Level 3 at least for the greater Seoul area due to economic concerns, calling it a last resort.  Level 3 restrictions would essentially mean a lockdown of Asia's fourth-largest economy, closing another 1.2 million businesses and allowing only essential workers into offices.  Health authorities blamed an outbreak at a Seoul prison for the fresh high daily tally but said they will gather on Sunday to decide whether distancing needs to be tightened to Level 3.

Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, said Santa was vaccinated against COVID-19 and could travel without risk of infection. ""I took a trip up there to the North Pole. I went there and I vaccinated Santa Claus myself,"" Fauci said during Sesame Street's coronavirus town hall meeting on CNN this week. ""He is good to go."" The director of Maine's public health department said on Thursday his agency received a lab report from the North Pole confirming that Santa had antibodies and was negative for the virus. ""Data show that the vaccine he received from Dr. Fauci is working,"" Dr. Nirav Shah wrote on Twitter. Vermont Governor Phil Scott lifted his state's quarantine restrictions for Santa, and the governors of New Jersey and New Mexico awarded Santa ""essential worker"" status.    ""Effective IMMEDIATELY, Santa and Mrs. Claus, with their elves and reindeer – including Rudolph – are permitted to fly in and around New Jersey from Christmas Eve into Christmas morning,"" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter.

2020-12-24,Reuters,"Turkey says China's Sinovac COVID vaccine 91.25% effective in late trials A COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O) is 91.25% effective, according to interim data from a late-stage trial in Turkey, a potentially much better result than reported from a separate trial of the vaccine in Brazil.   Researchers in Brazil, which is also running a final Phase III trial of the vaccine, said on Wednesday the shot was more than 50% effective, but withheld full results at the company's request, raising questions about transparency. Turkish researchers said on Thursday no major side-effects were seen during their trial, apart from one person who had an allergic reaction. Common adverse effects caused by the vaccine were fever, mild pain and slight fatigue, they said. The Turkish trials began on Sept. 14 and have included more than 7,000 volunteers, the researchers said, adding the results announced on Thursday were based on data from 1,322 people. Sinovac is the first Chinese vaccine maker to release details from late-stage clinical trials, following positive results from rival products developed by Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) last month. The Turkish researchers, speaking alongside Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, said 26 of the 29 people who were infected during the trial were given placebos, adding the trial would continue until 40 people become infected. ""We are now certain that the vaccine is effective and safe (to use) on Turkish people,"" Koca said, adding Ankara would use the data for licensing the vaccine. He also said that researchers initially planned to announce the results after 40 people were infected, but that the findings showed the volunteers had minimal adverse effects after the shot and that it was therefore deemed safe. ""Despite it being risky, we saw a very light picture where three people's PCR (COVID test) were positive, with no fever or respiratory problems... We can easily say that despite it being risky, those three people went through it very lightly,"" he said.

Oil prices dropped after an industry report showed an unexpected rise in U.S. crude oil inventories. O/R In a video posted on Twitter, Trump said a stimulus bill, agreed after months of wrangling in Congress, was ""a disgrace"" and that he wanted to increase ""ridiculously low"" $600 checks for individuals to $2,000.  ""Trump has derailed U.S. fiscal hopes, refusing to sign the $900 billion pandemic relief bill that was passed after a long-drawn stalemate between Democrats and Republicans,"" analysts at Mizuho wrote in a note to clients.  ""And so, hopes for an unambiguous ""Santa rally"" have been tragically hijacked."" Some traders said Trump's push for higher stimulus could lead to a spending increase. The bill could be amended if the congressional leadership wants to do so, and if they don't, Trump's choices are to sign the bill into law, veto it, or do nothing and let it become law.  The stimulus funds are needed as the U.S. recovery stalls and hospitals struggle to cope with a nationwide spike in coronavirus infections at the same time as an even more contagious variant of the disease spreads quickly in Britain. The possibility of a delay to such long-awaited and hard-fought spending plans sent S&P 500 futures  down as far as 1% below the index's Tuesday close, but they recovered to trade 0.22% higher.","Dec 23, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-4-2020-12-23/
2020-12-23,Reuters,"US STOCKS Wall Street gains on recovery bets Wall Street advanced on Wednesday as a pending stimulus deal and falling jobless claims prompted investors to bet on an economic recovery from the global health crisis. All three major indexes were higher, with the blue-chip Dow and small caps leading the gains. Economically vulnerable cyclical stocks, which were battered by mandated shutdowns and stand to benefit most from economic recovery, were outperforming.      The rotation into cyclicals reflects a growing confidence in recovery from the pandemic recession, and began in fits and starts after promising late-stage vaccine data was released in early November. ""A lot of names that have lagged all year because they were handicapped by COVID tend to do better as investors focus on reopening the economy,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""As we get good news on vaccines, those names get a boost."" The possibility of a year-end shutdown of the U.S. government, not to mention the lack of new fiscal stimulus, raised its head after President Donald Trump threatened to veto a $2.3 trillion funding package, which also includes a long-awaited $892 billion pandemic relief deal.  A Brexit trade deal between Britain and the European Union appeared more likely after a senior European diplomat told Reuters that an agreement could be imminent.  A raft of mixed economic data showed a welcome decrease in jobless claims and an uptick in new orders for durable goods, but also a pullback in consumer spending, dropping personal income and fading sentiment as the holiday shopping season nears its end amid a resurgent pandemic.  But languid inflation data provided further assurance that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its accommodative monetary policy at least until 2024.

Britain is already trying to curb the spread of a mutated strain of the virus which is up to 70% more transmissible, and further studies aerie being carried out on the new variant. ""This new variant is highly concerning, because it is yet more transmissible, and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant has been discovered in the UK,"" he said. Close contacts of those with the new variant and all those  who have been in South Africa in the last fortnight, or were in close contact with someone who had, must quarantine, he said.  Immediate restrictions were being imposed on travel from South Africa, he added. Countries around the world have in recent days closed their borders to both Britain and South Africa following the identification of the new, fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus.

2020-12-23,Reuters,"Federal judge blocks Trump administration drug pricing rule A federal judge on Wednesday blocked a last-minute Trump administration rule aimed at lowering drug prices as of next week. The rule, scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, would have tied reimbursements for 50 drugs by Medicare, a U.S. government insurance program, to the lowest prices paid by certain other countries. U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake in Maryland ruled that the administration had rushed the rule without giving the public a chance to comment, in violation of federal law. The decision is a victory for PhRMA, the nation's leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, which had filed a lawsuit challenging the so-called ""most favored nation""rule, arguing it would result in Medicare patients losing access to vital care. The group said Wednesday that it welcomed Blake's decision. The Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency that passed the rule, did not immediately respond to a  request for comment. The administration has said that the rule, which was unveiled in November, could save taxpayers and patients $85 billion over seven years. Blake's order is temporary, and could be lifted later if the administration ultimately prevails in the lawsuit. Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), a trade group, is also challenging the rule in a separate lawsuit in California. Efforts by the administration to keep down drug prices, such as a proposed rule to force drugmakers to reveal list prices in advertisements, have been undermined by successful industry lawsuits in the past. Since he lost the election, U.S. President Donald Trump has been issuing and finalizing a host of rule changes in areas ranging from energy to healthcare to immigration in a bid to bolster key areas of his agenda prior to leaving the White House in January.

2020-12-23,Reuters,"Powerful business lobby replaces ally of ex-Congo president Kabila Democratic Republic of Congo's main private business lobby replaced a close ally of former president Joseph Kabila as its chairman on Wednesday, further weakening Kabila in his power struggle with President Felix Tshisekedi. The board of the influential Congolese Business Federation (FEC) voted to elect Dieudonne Kasembo, a logistics company executive, over Albert Yuma, who had served as chairman for the past 15 years. Yuma's loss marks a fresh blow for Kabila, whose chosen successor lost the 2018 presidential election to Tshisekedi but had tried to maintain his influence through his political alliance's control of majorities in parliament.  That forced Tshisekedi into a governing coalition in which Kabila's allies controlled most ministries. But Tshisekedi  moved decisively against Kabila this month by announcing the end of the coalition and engineering the removal of a Kabila ally as parliament speaker. Yuma had been re-elected as FEC chairman on Nov. 26, but a federal court invalidated the election on procedural grounds. Yuma's allies boycotted Wednesday's re-vote, accusing Tshisekedi's administration of dictating the court's ruling.  The presidency denies it was involved.  Yuma is also the chairman of the state copper and cobalt mining company Gecamines. Under his leadership, Gecamines faced repeated allegations by local and international watchdogs that its money was used to fund Kabila's political interests.  Yuma and Kabila have always denied that.  As FEC chairman, Yuma oversaw the Chamber of Mines, where his support for a new mining code in 2018 that raised taxes on producers put him in conflict with foreign investors the chamber was supposed to represent, including Glencore (GLEN.L) and Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX.TO).  Congo is Africa's top producer of copper and the world's leading miner of cobalt, an ingredient in electric car batteries.","Dec 23, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/powerful-business-lobby-replaces-ally-ex-congo-president-kabila-2020-12-23/
2020-12-23,Reuters,"Telecom Italia to retain Nokia as supplier, curbing Huawei's share of 5G radio network - sources Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) has decided to retain Nokia (NOKIA.HE) as a supplier and reduce Huawei's (TLIT.MI) share of a planned purchase of equipment for building a 5G network, three sources close to the matter told Reuters, amid pressure to exclude the Chinese firm on security concerns. The United States has lobbied Italy and other European allies to avoid using Huawei's equipment alleging it could pose a security risk - a charge Huawei has rejected. Italy has so far declined to ban Huawei outright. Former national phone company Telecom Italia (TIM) at the beginning of this year was considering dividing a supply contract for the radio access network (RAN) part of its 5G build-out between Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson (ERICb.ST), sources told Reuters. The RAN infrastructure includes the base stations and antennas that connect smartphones to the mobile network, and accounts for the bulk of the cost of a new network. Finland's Nokia - which has previously been among TIM's mobile radio access network equipment suppliers - was set to miss out on the 5G RAN order, according to the sources. But the agreement has since been reviewed. ""Ericsson will provide the bulk of the equipment, while Huawei and Nokia will get a 20-25% each"", one of the sources said on Wednesday.  ""The negotiations are still going on about issues including the percentage of reduction,"" another source said. Huawei, TIM, Nokia and Ericsson all declined to comment.

2020-12-23,Reuters,"Trump EPA retains ozone standards despite COVID-19 link to air pollution The Trump administration on Wednesday finalized a 5-year-old air quality standard for ozone pollution despite calls by environmental groups to toughen the rule because people harmed by air pollution are more vulnerable to COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency, which retained the 2015 standards in the final month of U.S. President Donald Trump's term, said it had streamlined the review of the air standard and completed the rules within five years after the Obama administration proposed it, as mandated by Congress.  Long-term exposure to ozone can damage lungs and boost medical bills. It is emitted by vehicles, power plants, boilers, and refineries, and is a main component of smog.  Studies have shown that people who have suffered health problems from long-term exposure to air pollutants, including ozone, can face increased risk of getting COVID-19. Ann Weeks, legal director at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, said it was ""morally unconscionable"" to finalize the rule during a respiratory pandemic, less than a month before EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler leaves his post. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes over on Jan. 20, has promised to roll back actions that the Trump administration has taken to ease environmental regulations and to toughen standards on pollution. The EPA move could be challenged by environmental and health groups in the courts.   The finalization limits ozone levels to 70 parts per billion (ppb). The Obama-Biden EPA had increased the stringency of the standard to that level from the 2008 standard of 75 ppb.  Lawmakers from industrial states praised the move saying it protects health while avoiding business costs as economies recover from the pandemic.   The standard ""supports local communities now fighting to get back on their feet, while continuing to drive improved air quality under existing programs,"" said nearly 30 Republican U.S. congressional representatives in a statement.

Britain will complete its departure from the EU on Dec. 31 when its current free trade arrangements expire. The two sides have been struggling for months to define a new relationship covering everything from trade to transport and energy. The much-delayed final stages of the already tortuous negotiations now coincide with a fresh crisis after EU members and other countries suspended most travel to and from Britain to curb a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus. ""We are really in a crucial moment. We are giving it a final push,"" said the negotiator, Michel Barnier, as he arrived to update the bloc's 27 national envoys on Brexit. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said he believed  negotiators were more likely than not to strike a deal, but that talks may go beyond Dec. 25.  Barnier told the closed-door gathering that the UK's latest offer on sharing out the fish catch from British waters from 2021 was ""totally unacceptable"", according to EU diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Barnier is walking a tightrope between London and Paris,"" said one diplomat in Brussels, a reference to the small but politically prominent fishing community in northern France that would be affected by any reduction of the EU catch. A senior diplomat who took part in the meeting with Barnier said the EU's latest offer on fish was its final one, and added that there was still concern around regulating production standards and state aid to ensure corporate fair play.

SQM, the world's No.2 producer of lithium, said the contract would run between 2021 and 2029 and involves the supply of approximately 55,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, SQM  said in a statement. Pablo Altimiras, who oversees SQM's lithium business, said the deal demonstrated confidence in the quality of the company's product.      ""These are long-term contracts that point to SQM's stability,"" Altimiras said, adding that the company would continue seeking out such deals in the future. South Korea’s LG Chem (051910.KS), an electric car battery supplier for Tesla Inc and GM, said in September that it would separate its battery making business into a new company - LG Energy Solution - to meet growing demand from European car makers and increasing sales of cylindrical batteries used in Tesla cars. Car and battery makers in the United States, Europe and China are scrambling to lock down supplies of lithium ahead of an anticipated boom in demand for electric vehicles. Many miners had moved to boost output ahead of the rush, but the COVID-19 pandemic largely temporarily slammed the brakes on the electric vehicle revolution, driving down prices, denting profits and forcing many companies to shelve expansion plans. In November, SQM nonetheless said its plans to boost its production of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide by the second half of 2021 were still on track.

2020-12-21,Reuters,"GLOBAL MARKETS New COVID-19 strain inflicts pain on stocks, sterling, threatens more volatility European shares fell 2% on Monday, the dollar strengthened and market volatility surged amid growing unease over the economic impact of a new coronavirus strain in Britain which has seen several European countries shut their borders to the UK. The news of the new strain, said to be up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has put some 16 million Britons under tougher lockdowns and has overshadowed U.S. lawmakers' agreement over a long-awaited stimulus bill. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair an emergency response meeting to discuss international travel and the flow of freight in and out of Britain.  Coinciding with the lack of a post-Brexit trade deal ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, those developments sent the pound almost 2% lower at $1.3272 . Losses of more than 1% on UK equities (.FTSE), (.FTMC) were led by 6%-7% tumbles at banks Lloyds and Barclays. German shares fell around 2%, while pan-European travel and leisure stocks lost more than 5% (.GDAXI), (.SXTP). MUFG analysts noted the tougher restrictions might have to remain place for months until more people are vaccinated. ""As a result, the economic slowdown will prove deeper and extend further into next year. It will dampen optimism over a stronger economic recovery in 2021,"" they told clients, noting this setback could necessitate more monetary stimulus. Volatility, a measure of price swings on an asset class, swung higher across the board, with Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" the VIX -- rising above 25% for the first time since Dec. 11 (.VIX).

The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in the red, but financials helped the blue-chip Dow reverse course for a modest gain. ""While there's talk of the sell-off being related to the new COVID strain, my sense is air's being let out of the balloon,"" said Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""We got ahead of ourselves in terms of market performance and we still have significant economic headwinds.""

The $900 billion package, expected to pass on Monday, includes unemployment aid and steers money to small businesses, airlines, transit systems and vaccine distribution.  ""Last week it was pretty clear we were going to get something, but (the stimulus package) is on the low end of what people were hoping for,"" Pursche said. But the emergence of new, highly infectious strain of COVID-19 in Britain has raised fears of additional shutdowns, and prompted countries around the world to shut their doors to travelers from the United Kingdom. The news sent airline stocks sliding, even with the prospect of $15 billion in payroll assistance for commercial carriers included in the stimulus deal.

""The position is unchanged: there are problems,"" Johnson told reporters when asked if there would be a trade deal. ""Its vital that everybody understands that the UK has got to be able to control its own laws completely and also that we've got to be able to control our own fisheries."" ""WTO terms would be more than satisfactory for the UK. And we can certainly cope with any difficulties that are thrown our way. Not that we don't want a deal but that WTO terms would be entirely satisfactory,"" he said. Unless Johnson can strike a trade deal with the EU in the next 10 days, the United Kingdom will leave the bloc's informal membership on Dec. 31 at 2300 London time without one.  Johnson said he spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, who turned 43 today, about border issues, but not about Brexit. ""Its his birthday by the way, but we vowed to stick off Brexit because that negotiation is being conducted as you know via the European Commission and that's quite proper,"" Johnson said.  A Brexit trade deal would ensure that the goods trade which makes up half of annual EU-UK commerce, worth nearly a trillion dollars in all, would remain free of tariffs and quotas. Britain says the talks are stuck on two issues - the so-called level playing field and fishing - and has repeatedly said the EU has to budge or there will be no deal. Failure to agree a deal on goods trade would send shockwaves through financial markets, hurt European economies, snarl borders and disrupt supply chains.  In the case of a ""no deal"" on trade, Britain would lose zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the European single market of 450 million consumers overnight.","Dec 21, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-johnson-says-brexit-still-problems-well-thrive-without-deal-2020-12-21/

2020-12-21,Reuters,"Peru suspends flights from Europe as coronavirus cases near one million Peru suspended flights from Europe for two weeks and has put its health and travel authorities on high alert to prevent the entry of a new strain of coronavirus that appeared in the United Kingdom, President Francisco Sagasti said on Monday. Sagasti said no direct flights from the United Kingdom had entered the country since December 15, when flights from Europe restarted. But health authorities were monitoring passengers from Britain who had entered through connecting flights, he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that a new strain of the coronavirus had led to surging infection numbers, prompting countries worldwide to suspend flights to and from the United Kingdom.  The announcement comes as hard-hit Peru nears one million cases of COVID-19, amid growing concerns over a second wave of the virus following the end-of-year holidays. Health officials in Peru have prohibited the use of private vehicles on Dec. 24, 25 and 31, as well as on New Year's Day to reduce movement, and have discouraged Peruvians from visiting family over the holidays.  In addition to suspending flights from the United Kingdom, Peru on Monday also prohibited the entry of non-resident foreigners who had been in the UK in the last two weeks. Peruvians or non-residents already in the country who had recently visited the United Kingdom will be required to spend 14 days in isolation. Coronavirus cases in Peru hit 997,517 on Sunday, with 37,103 deaths from the disease, according to official figures. Peru has already signed a preliminary agreement with Pfizer to buy 9.9 million doses of its vaccine, and inked a firm deal with the Covax Facility, an alliance led by the World Health Organization, to acquire another 13.2 million doses.  Sagasti's government said last week it did not know when the first doses would be arriving in the Andean nation, nor how many would be included in the first shipment.

2020-12-21,Reuters,"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley lead U.S. bank rally after stress test U.S. bank shares outperformed the broader market on Monday, led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, after the Federal Reserve said stress test results meant the sector could resume stock buybacks for the first time since the coronavirus-led downturn.  The Fed said the biggest U.S. banks had enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and would now be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis.  Earlier this year, the Fed barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This was its second bank ""stress test"" for 2020, the first time the Fed has done two in a year since annual health checks began after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.  Goldman (GS.N) shares were last up 7.2% after surpassing their January high for the first time since the COVID-crisis. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) was up 5.9% and trading at its highest since September 2007.  In comparison, the S&P 500 bank subsector (.SPXBK), which does not include Goldman or Morgan Stanley, was up 3.1%.  The regulator's decision came quicker than many investors had expected and suggested Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs investors were in line for bigger buybacks than the majority of the sector, according to Piper Sander analyst Jeffery Harte. ""Overall, the amount of share buybacks the Fed's math suggests the big banks will be able to make in the first quarter of 2021 is good news for the group,"" said Harte. As for Goldman Sachs, Harte noted that investors had worried more about the bank's dividend prospects during the pandemic.   ""It's quite a positive change from people being concerned Goldman wouldn't be able to maintain their dividend to being able to buyback more stocks than most of the sector,"" he said.","Dec 21, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-lead-us-bank-rally-after-stress-test-2020-12-21/
2020-12-21,Reuters,"Trump administration cuts size of Arctic land offered for oil auction In a last-minute change, the Trump administration cut about 30 percent of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge territory that it plans to auction off for oil exploration. The decision was announced late Friday by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the agency managing the oil lease sale. The ANWR lease sale is scheduled for Jan. 6, but under the BLM’s plan, companies may submit bids starting on Monday. The reduction comes as the U.S. Department of the Interior prepares a legal defense for its ANWR leasing plan, and as the Trump administration tries to engineer a lease sale just weeks before Democrat Joe Biden, an opponent of ANWR drilling, takes office on Jan. 20. The BLM said it shrank the size of the lease sale after reviewing comments from drilling opponents worried about the herd of caribou that uses the coastal plain, and drilling supporters who made suggestions about sites most likely to hold oil. The original plan was to offer 1.56 million acres for lease; the amendment cuts 457,000 acres from the offering.      Opponents, including the Gwich’in Steering Committee, which represents the indigenous Gwich’in people of northeastern Alaska and northwestern Canada, have filed four lawsuits seeking to overturn the plan. The reduced size of the sale will not change opponents’ positions, Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, said late Sunday.  “Any disturbance or disruption to the coastal plain is a direct attack on the Gwich’in way of life and the Gwich’in people,” she said. A federal judge in Alaska said last week that she hopes to rule by Jan. 6, the day of the scheduled lease sale, on a restraining order that could pause the plan. President-elect Biden has said he wants to grant the refuge coastal plain permanent protection from oil development. His nominee for Interior secretary, U.S. House Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, is a staunch opponent of ANWR oil drilling.

2020-12-21,Reuters,"U.S. airlines prepare employee recalls as relief nears; United calls them 'temporary' American Airlines (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.O) said on Monday they were preparing to recall tens of thousands of furloughed employees as they awaited lawmakers' approval of a fresh $15 billion in payroll support under a broader COVID-19 relief package. But in a staff memo, United executives warned that it expects the recall will be ""temporary"" as travel demand remains depressed. The relief would cover employee payroll costs until March 31, 2021. ""The truth is, we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months,"" CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart said in the memo, released by United.  Wrestling with a sharp downturn in travel demand amid the pandemic, American and United together furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October, when an initial $25 billion to cover six months of airline workers' salaries expired. The House of Representatives and Senate were aiming to pass a bipartisan $900 billion coronavirus aid package before the end of the day.  The $15 billion earmarked for airlines requires all furloughed workers to be recalled and receive their full salaries from Dec. 1 through March 31, 2021.  ""We are already starting to work through the details of how we will bring back team members, but we’re not over the finish line yet,"" American CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo, adding that they hoped employees would receive paychecks by Dec. 24.  The terms of the new assistance program mirror the initial package passed by Congress in March, which required larger airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time and offer the government warrants.  It also requires airlines to resume flying to some routes stopped after the first package expires, and gives the Transportation secretary authority until March 1, 2022 to require flights to small and remote communities that airlines served before the pandemic.

The vaccinations, carried out under a program led by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), are the latest effort to rein in a pandemic that has killed more than 317,000 Americans and strained healthcare systems. California, an epicenter in the latest surge in infections, had no more intensive care unit beds available in the heavily populated Los Angeles area or in the state's San Joaquin Valley agricultural hub, Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday.  Newsom said California had so far not seen any cases of the highly infectious new strain of the virus that has emerged in Britain, prompting dozens of countries to close their borders to the UK.  The United States has not imposed travel restrictions from Britain in the face of the mutant strain. Three airlines, acting at the request of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have agreed to screen passengers flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized emergency use of two COVID-19 vaccines, one developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE  and the second from Moderna Inc (MRNA.O).

2020-12-21,Reuters,"INSIGHT Big Tech's stealth push to influence the Biden administration Silicon Valley is working behind the scenes to secure senior roles for tech allies in lesser-known but still vital parts of president-elect Joe Biden's administration, even as the pushback against Big Tech from progressive groups and regulators grows.  The Biden transition team has already stacked its agency review teams with more tech executives than tech critics. It has also added to its staff several officials from Big Tech companies, which emerged as top donors to the campaign. Now, executives and employees at tech companies such as Alphabet Inc-owned Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are pushing to place candidates in senior roles at government agencies, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.     The agencies many of these executives are aiming for include the U.S. Commerce Department, Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs - a key agency under the White House Office of Management & Budget which drafts policies impacting the tech industry, the State Department and the Department of Defense, according to the sources. Many company executives, who in some cases helped raise money for the Biden campaign or have ties to those on the president-elect's transition team, still have a huge commercial interest in pushing candidates with industry ties at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – both of which are investigating whether Big Tech abused its market power. But the spotlight on those agencies from progressive interest groups and members of Congress is likely to make it much harder for Silicon Valley to succeed, the sources said. To be sure, there is no formal process via which such names and recommendations are being floated by company executives to the transition team. A Biden transition spokesman Cameron French said agency review team members and future administration appointees will be committed to implementing Biden's policy ideas.  ""Each member of the Biden-Harris transition and incoming administration will have values that align with the President and Vice President-elect on a host of issues including the tech sector,"" he said. Facebook and Microsoft declined comment.

The Boeing 747 exploded and killed 190 Americans. ""No amount of time or distance will stop the United States and our Scottish partners from pursuing justice in this case,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr told a news conference Monday. The suspect, Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al-Marimi, a former senior Libyan intelligence official, is charged with two criminal counts related to the bombing. He is in Libyan custody, Barr said Monday, and U.S. officials are hopeful that Libya will allow Masud to be tried in the United States. The Justice Department said Masud worked in various capacities for Libyan intelligence, including as a technical expert in building explosive devices from approximately 1973 to 2011. It also alleged Masud was involved in the 1986 bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in West Berlin, Germany that killed two U.S. service members. In 1991, two other Libyan intelligence operatives were charged in the bombing: Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.       Megrahi was found guilty in Scotland of the Lockerbie bombing in 2001 and freed in 2009 on compassionate release grounds before dying of cancer in 2012. Barr said the breakthrough that led to Masud's charges came after law enforcement learned in 2016 that the third alleged conspirator ""had been arrested after the collapse of the Qaddafi regime and interviewed by a Libyan law enforcement officer in September 2012.""

2020-12-21,Reuters,"Report: NHL teams could raise $15M through helmet ads 2020-12-21 17:21:52 GMT+00:00 - National Hockey League teams could bring in a combined $15 million by placing sponsors' ads on helmets in the 2020-21 season, TSN reported Monday. The Canadian outlet said some higher-profile teams, such as the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs, could command as much as $1 million each, with other teams looking for smaller deals. Sports Business Daily reported last week that the NHL likely would approve the ad placement for the season. The effort could help clubs recoup some of the money lost by limited or no attendance amid the coronavirus pandemic, but also to give added value to big sponsors. Only one sponsor name would be allowed on a helmet. The report said that the ads could serve as a pilot program to allow the NHL to gather data about helmet sponsorships and their longer-term market value, which could be worth about $2.5 million for an ""average team"" beyond this season. On Sunday, the NHL and NHL Players' Association announced an agreement on a 56-game regular season that'll start Jan. 13 and end May 8. Although the NHL's return to play from the pandemic this summer included a play-in round of playoffs, the plan for this season is a traditional 16-team, best-of-seven, four-round tournament that could last until mid-July. The hope is that the NHL will be able to return to its regular calendar at the conclusion of this season plus the 2021 NHL Draft. The NBA sells sponsorship patches on its jerseys. In March 2019, when the Oklahoma City Thunder became the final team to add a patch, ESPN said the other 29 teams were bringing in an estimated $150 million per season. --Field Level Media  ","Dec 21, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/report-nhl-teams-could-raise-15m-through-helmet-ads-2020-12-21/

2020-12-21,Reuters,"Total crypto fund inflows top $5 bln this year, up more than 600% - report Total investor inflows into cryptocurrency funds and products hit $5.6 billion so far this year, up more than 600% from 2019, according to the latest data from asset manager CoinShares. The inflows plus the latest price moves lifted assets under management for the sector to nearly $19 billion in 2020. Assets under management ended 2019 at just $2.57 billion. Interest in cryptocurrencies skyrocketed this year as investors saw bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and as an alternative to the depreciating dollar. Bitcoin hit yet another all-time peak of $24,298.04 on Sunday, but was last down nearly 3% at $22,832.78 , hit by a wave of risk-off moves in financial markets on worries about the new coronavirus strain.  On Monday ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, fell 4.4% to $610.14 . Inflows into investment crypto investment products totaled $335 million as of Friday, with bitcoin flows accounting for $792.1 million, the data showed. Ethereum had $207.3 million in weekly flows. So far this year, investors pumped $15.6 billion into bitcoin products and funds, while ethereum inflows reached nearly $2.5 billion. ""It's no secret that there are a few big players in the bitcoin/crypto space and that it is mostly crowded with retail-related traders and investors,"" said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts, a technical analysis and financial charting platform for online retail investors. ""The current jump will certainly attract new retail money, but we are also already seeing adoption by more institutions. I think the question is whether institutions can afford not to participate, and for how long,"" he added. Grayscale, the world's largest crypto fund, had $250.8 million inflows in the latest week, raising its assets under management to $15.3 billion. So far this year, Grayscale has amassed inflows of nearly $5 billion, the CoinShares report said.","Dec 21, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/total-crypto-fund-inflows-top-5-bln-this-year-up-more-than-600-report-2020-12-21/

The world's first big computing firm has set its sights on the so-called hybrid cloud, where it sees a $1 trillion market opportunity as more companies use a combination of their own datacenters and leased computing resources to manage and process data. IBM did not disclose on Monday how much it paid for the Finland-based firm. Since taking office in April, Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna has acquired at least five startups from the hybrid cloud space. Krishna was the principal architect behind IBM's $34 billion Red Hat deal last year.

2020-12-20,Reuters,"Central African Republic opposition calls for election delay due to violence Central African Republic's main opposition coalition on Sunday demanded the Dec. 27 election be postponed due to violence by armed groups outside the capital Bangui, but the government insisted the vote would go ahead. On Saturday, the authorities accused former president Francois Bozize of plotting a coup after his candidacy was rejected. United Nations peacekeepers also dispersed armed rebel groups occupying roads and towns near Bangui. Fighting was going on in several towns, including Mbaiki, about 100 km (62 miles) from Bangui on Sunday, according to one security source and two humanitarian sources.                                         The opposition alliance, called Cod2020, which includes Bozize, said violence was preventing presidential and parliamentary candidates from campaigning and had led to the destruction of electoral material and threats in almost all provincial centres, without providing details. In a statement, it ""noted the impossibility of pursuing an electoral campaign in current insecure conditions,"" and demanded the postponement of the vote until stability is restored. In response, the government said it was doing everything possible to ensure the vote could take place as planned, deploying troops alongside U.N. peacekeepers to regain control of occupied towns. ""There is no plan B, the elections will take place on December 27,"" government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui said. A number of planes from Russia, an ally of President Faustin-Archange, landed in Central African Republic this weekend, the security source and a source at the airport said. The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on whether Russia had sent planes. It has previously sent arms and security contractors to CAR, while Russian national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to Touadera. In a statement on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry said a representative had talked with CAR's foreign minister by phone to reaffirm Russia's support for the country and its government's efforts to ensure security.","Dec 20, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/central-african-republic-opposition-calls-election-delay-due-violence-2020-12-20/

France said it would bar all people coming from the United Kingdom for 48 hours from Sunday night, including freight carriers, whether by road, air, sea or rail. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands ordered a suspension of flights from Britain, while Ireland said it would impose restrictions on flights and ferries from its neighbour.

""The COVID variant recently discovered in London is worrying and will need to be investigated by our scientists,"" Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said. ""In the meantime we choose the path of maximum prudence."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that the new strain had led to spiralling infection numbers. His  government tightened its COVID-19 restrictions for London and nearby areas, and also reversed plans to ease restrictions over the Christmas period.  The travel curbs also compound problems for the United Kingdom as it finally exits the European Union on Dec. 31 after a transition period this year. London and Brussels have so far failed to reach a post-Brext trade deal, raising the prospect of chaos in goods traffic. The German government said all flights from the United Kingdom would be suspended from midnight.

2020-12-20,Reuters,"Japan's record $1 trln budget highlights COVID-19 challenge to growth, debt Japan's cabinet approved on Monday a record $1.03 trillion budget draft for the next fiscal year starting in April 2021, the Ministry of Finance said, as the coronavirus and stimulus spending puts pressure on already dire public finances. The 106.6 trillion yen ($1.03 trillion) annual budget also got a boost from record military and welfare outlays. It marked a 4% rise from this year's initial level and up for nine years in a row, with new debt making up more than a third of revenue. From Europe to America, policymakers globally have unleashed a torrent of monetary and fiscal stimulus to prevent a deep and prolonged recession as the pandemic shut international borders and sent many out of work. In Japan, fiscal reform has been shelved as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga prioritised efforts to contain the pandemic and boost growth, despite public debt at more than twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy. ""How to balance the coronavirus response with fiscal reform has hardly been debated in Japan,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research. ""Ultra-low interest rates under the Bank of Japan's prolonged monetary easing may have caused fiscal discipline to be paralysed.""     The spending plan, which was in line with a Reuters report out last week, must be approved by parliament early next year. It will be rolled out along with a third extra budget for this fiscal year as a combined 15-month budget aimed for seamless spending to ease the virus pain and back Suga's goal of achieving carbon neutrality and digital transformation. The government's fiscal 2021 primary budget deficit - excluding new bond sales and debt servicing - is seen at 20.4 trillion yen, more than double this year's initial estimates, making the budget-balancing goal further elusive. Rating agency Fitch in July cut its outlook on Japan's debt rating to negative from stable, warning of the COVID-19 impact on rising public debt. ""The massive stimulus spending rolled out this fiscal year may raise worry about 'fiscal cliff', which could justify calls for more spending in the coming fiscal year,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.","Dec 20, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-record-1-trln-budget-highlights-covid-19-challenge-growth-debt-2020-12-21/
2020-12-20,Reuters,"U.S. lawmakers back $15 billion in airline payroll assistance A bipartisan legislative deal unveiled by U.S. lawmakers on Sunday will grant U.S. airlines $15 billion in new payroll assistance that will allow them to return more than 32,000 furloughed workers to payrolls through March 31, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. The support is part of $45 billion earmarked for the transportation sector in a $900 billion package for COVID-19 relief. Amtrak, the nation's largest passenger railroad firm, is due to receive $1 billion while $14 billion will go to public transit systems and $10 billion to state highways, a senior Democratic aide said. The legislation is also expected to include significant changes to how the Federal Aviation Administration certifies new airplanes following two Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people, three congressional aides said, but specific details were not immediately available. The sources declined to be identified as the package's details have yet to be formally unveiled.     The aviation assistance comes after five months of furious lobbying - first by aviation unions and later by airline executives - who argued the industry desperately needed new government help as travel demand remains devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
U.S. transit systems have also warned that without new government aid they could be forced to make draconian cuts in service and employment. U.S. airlines furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October, after a six-month $25 billion bailout measure expired on Sept. 30. American Airlines (AAL.O) alone furloughed 19,000 employees, while United Airlines (UAL.O) furloughed more than 13,000. The U.S. Transportation Department said U.S. passenger airlines had 368,000 full-time workers as of Oct. 15.     Airline workers will be paid retroactive to Dec. 1 and airlines will have to resume flying some routes they stopped after the aid package expired, congressional aides briefed on the talks said. Airline workers cannot be furloughed through March 31 as a condition of the assistance. Airlines should receive funds about 10 days after the bill is signed, sources said.","Dec 20, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-lawmakers-back-15-billion-airline-payroll-assistance-2020-12-20/

Australia's most populous state on Sunday reported six new cases of the novel coronavirus in people returning from overseas and in quarantine, and authorities said among them were two cases of the fast-spreading new strain. However, New South Wales officials stressed that no people infected with the new strain were believed to be circulating in the community.

Authorities were also hopeful they were getting to grips with a flare-up of the virus in Sydney after New South Wales reported its lowest one-day rise in new infections in three days. The state said 15 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, down from the 30 the previous day, bringing the total number of cases in a new outbreak centred on Sydney's northern beaches to 83.  ""I'm pleased with what we've seen overnight, but again, it's volatile,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.

Lawmakers will also back $3.2 billion for an emergency broadband benefit for low-income Americans, senior congressional aides confirmed after Reuters first reported the planned broadband spending. The COVID-19 relief bill invests $7 billion to increase access to broadband, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, adding the low-income program will ""help millions of students, families and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic."" The Federal Communications Commission said in June it had formally designated China’s Huawei Technologies Co (HWT.UL) and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) as threats, a declaration that bars U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies. Earlier this month, the FCC finalized rules that require carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to ""rip and replace"" that equipment but is awaiting funding from Congress. Huawei said earlier this month it was disappointed in the FCC’s decision ""to force removal of our products from telecommunications networks. This overreach puts U.S. citizens at risk in the largely underserved rural areas – during a pandemic - when reliable communication is essential."" The bill ""establishes a temporary, emergency broadband benefit program at the FCC to help low-income Americans, including those economically challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, get connected or remain connected to broadband,"" according to a fact sheet seen by Reuters. The source also said the program will supply a $50 monthly subsidy to qualifying households ""to help them afford broadband service and an internet-connected device."" The bill also expands eligibility for the rip-and-replace reimbursement program to communications providers with 10 million subscribers or less but prioritizes reimbursement for providers with 2 million subscribers or less, the source said, citing a draft fact sheet. The bill will include $285 million for connecting minority communities and will establish an Office of Minority Broadband Initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).","Dec 20, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-lawmakers-back-19-billion-replace-telecom-equipment-chinas-huawei-zte-sources-2020-12-20/

2020-12-19,Reuters,"China issues national security rules on foreign investment China published rules on Saturday for reviewing foreign investment on national security grounds, potentially broad measures that it insisted did not amount to protectionism. The review system announced by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) covers foreign investments in military sectors and the acquisition of controlling stakes in such sectors as energy, natural resources, agriculture, internet technology and financial services. ""Only by tightening the fence against security risks can China lay the solid foundations for a new round of opening up that is broader, wider and deeper,"" the commission said.   This was in line with international practice and would help balance the economic benefits of further opening with the need to ensure national security, the NDRC said. The announcement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump ratchets up tensions with China in his final weeks in office. Washington added dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist on Friday.  Publishing the investment rules is ""not protectionism or backtracking from opening-up policies,"" the NDRC said, asserting that ""opening up without protection is not sustainable.""  Major economies like the United States, the European Union, Australia, Germany and Japan have established or improved their review mechanisms on foreign investment in recent years, it said. The new system will establish a body dedicated to security reviews, headed by the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce. The rules, which take effect in 30 days, follow a foreign investment law published last year aimed at broadening market access for overseas investors. Last year's foreign investment law made it clear China would set up a review mechanism for foreign investment, and foreign companies and trade associations have been awaiting the new rules so that they can make investment decisions, the NDRC said.

With less than two weeks before Britain leaves the EU's orbit, both sides are calling on the other to move to achieve a breakthrough after nine months of talks and safeguard trade in goods from tariffs and quotas. Since Britain left the EU in January, the talks have been largely hamstrung over two issues - the bloc's fishing rights in British waters and on creating a so-called level playing field providing fair competition rules for both sides. There is little time left. Both sides need to get any deal approved by their parliaments, and with the talks in their final stages, it is expected that any conclusion will most likely come before Christmas. ""We need to get any deal right and based on terms which respect what the British people voted for. Unfortunately, the EU are still struggling to get the flexibility needed from Member States and are continuing to make demands that are incompatible with our independence,"" the source said. ""We cannot accept a deal that doesn't leave us in control of our own laws or waters. We're continuing to try every possible path to an agreement, but without a substantial shift from the Commission we will be leaving on WTO (World Trade Organization) terms on December 31."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the face of Britain's 2016 campaign to leave the EU, has long said he cannot accept any deal that does not respect the country's sovereignty, a goal that was at the heart of his election last year. But the EU is equally determined to protect its lucrative single market and wants to prevent London securing what it considers to be the best of both worlds - preferential market access with the advantage of setting its rules. Many businesses fear a failure to agree a deal on goods trade would send shockwaves through financial markets, hurt European economies, snarl borders and disrupt supply chains. While there has been some progress in the talks, the British side has taken a more pessimistic view, regularly saying that a no deal outcome was the most likely.","Dec 19, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-will-take-no-deal-if-eu-fails-shift-brexit-trade-says-source-2020-12-19/
2020-12-19,Reuters,"Golf-Kim leads Ko by one at LPGA Tour season finale Defending champion Kim Sei-young of South Korea held a one-shot lead over compatriot and world number one Ko Jin-young after the third round of the LPGA's season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, on Saturday. Kim, who carded six birdies through her first 13 holes and was blemish-free on the day until a bogey at last, shot a five-under-par 67 that brought her to 13 under on the week at Tiburon Golf Club. If Kim, who also led last year's season finale after 54 holes, can close out the win it would be the first time she has successfully defended a title and make her the only three-time winner of the 2020 campaign. ""Really good chance to chase everything,"" said Kim. ""If I play well tomorrow, good chance."" Kim could take over as world number one in the rankings with a win this week along with Ko finishing solo 10th or worse.   England's Georgia Hall (68) had a relatively quiet start to the day with eight pars and a lone bogey on the front nine but stormed home with five birdies over her last eight holes to sit alone in third place and three shots back of Kim. ""I hit it pretty good today as well. I just didn't hole many on the front nine, so I had to stay patient,"" said Hall, who won her lone major at the 2018 Women's British Open. ""Managed to get a couple early in the back nine and then just followed in from there really."" Five players are tied for fourth at nine under, including past champions Charley Hull (2016) and Lexi Thompson (2018) and world number six Brooke Henderson, one of six players to card the day's low round of six-under-66.

2020-12-18,Reuters,"U.S. charges China-based Zoom executive with disrupting Tiananmen crackdown commemorations U.S. prosecutors on Friday charged a former China-based executive at Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) with disrupting video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown at the request of the Chinese government. Xinjiang Jin, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of conspiring since January 2019 to use his company's systems to censor speech, the U.S. Department of Justice said. In a complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors said the software engineer, Zoom's main liaison with Chinese law enforcement and intelligence, helped terminate at least four video meetings in May and June, including some involving dissidents who survived the June 4, 1989, student protests. Jin allegedly fabricated violations of Zoom's terms of service to justify his actions to his superiors. Prosecutors also said his accomplices created fake email accounts and Zoom accounts, including in dissidents' names, to suggest meeting hosts and participants supported terrorism, violence and child pornography. In a blog post, Zoom said it fired Jin for violating the San Jose, California-based company's policies, and has placed other employees on leave. It also said there was no indication that enterprise data was shared with China's government. Zoom said it is cooperating with subpoenas from federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and northern California regarding its dealings with China's government, and with a separate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena. Jin is not in U.S. custody, and a lawyer for him could not be located. The complaint cited many communications by Jin, including whether an account hosting a meeting with a dissident he called ""a lead of such illegal political activities"" could be suspended for 24 hours ""to prevent subsequent huge influence on us?""     Jin's actions helped Chinese authorities ""censor and punish U.S. users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement.","Dec 18, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-charges-china-based-zoom-executive-with-disrupting-tiananmen-crackdown-2020-12-18/

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) broke a four-day rally to end 0.4% lower, reversing gains that followed a surprise rise in German business morale in December. The German DAX (.GDAXI) gave up gains of as much as 0.8% to end in the red. The Ifo institute's upbeat data came even as Europe's biggest economy went into a strict lockdown to contain a second wave of coronavirus infections.  Britain's exporter-heavy index (.FTSE) lost 0.3%, despite a weaker pound after Britain and the European Union said they remained far apart on a number of issues and that it was becoming more likely they would fail to reach a trade agreement before a Dec. 31 deadline.  ""This is the real final crunch time, so that will likely effect the markets in a broader sense rather than just the pound play,"" said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex.  In the United States, Congress looked increasingly unlikely to meet a deadline to agree on $900 billion in fresh COVID-19 aid and instead may pass a third stopgap spending bill to keep the government from shutting down at midnight.  ""Markets are heading into the weekend with these two big unknowns. Investors may not get to react until Monday morning because the answer, especially for Brexit, might be between Sunday and Monday morning,"" Campbell said.  The STOXX 600 ended the week with a 1.5% gain, its sixth week in the black in seven.

2020-12-18,Reuters,"Fed sees 'strong capital levels' at banks after stress tests, greenlights share buybacks The largest U.S. banks have enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and will be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis, the U.S. Federal Reserve said. The central bank on Friday released the results of its second bank ""stress test"" for 2020, the first time it has put banks through their paces twice in one year since it began the annual health checks following the decade-ago financial crisis. The Fed had previously barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves during the coronavirus pandemic. The results of the second test of 2020, which the Fed pursued to reflect the severe economic impact of the pandemic, found that banks suffered more severe losses than under the previous test. But months of building up reserves helped ensure they were positioned to weather the downturn well, with firms building capital reserves in 2020 despite setting aside nearly $100 billion in loan loss reserves. The Fed found all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking those hypothetical losses, leading the central bank to relax its restrictions on capital payouts by banks, allowing them to buy back stock in the first quarter of 2021, after barring them in June.     ""The banking system has been a source of strength during the past year and today’s stress test results confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy,"" said Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles in a statement. However, Fed Governor Lael Brainard dissented from the decision to allow banks to buy back stock, arguing it would be more prudent to have banks hold that capital to ensure they can continue lending.  Under the new restrictions, a bank would be allowed to pay out dividends and buy back stock so long as such sums did not exceed its net income from the last year. The Fed also announced it would not use the new results to tweak how much it ordered each bank to hold as a ""stress capital buffer"" following the previous test results. See FACTBOX for more on how this year's tests have changed  The new leeway from the Fed will send bank analysts off to calculate how much each bank might be able to spend on share buybacks in coming months based on their estimated fourth quarter earnings. Bank executives including Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), have said most lenders have excess capital and they want to begin buybacks as soon as allowed.","Dec 18, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-sees-strong-capital-levels-banks-after-stress-tests-greenlights-share-2020-12-18/

Buyoya died just two months after being convicted in absentia by a court in Burundi of the 1993 murder of a successor, a killing that triggered more than a decade of ethnic bloodletting. ""The death of former president Pierre Buyoya is confirmed. There is no more doubt,"" the head of the information and communications division at the office of Burundi's President Willy Nyamitwe said in a tweet. At the time of his death, Buyoya had been living in Mali, where he had held a post as an envoy of the African Union. An official at the Clinique Pasteur in the Malian capital Bamako told Reuters Buyoya had been treated there before being evacuated to Paris overnight. He gave no further details. A relative of Buyoya, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters Buyoya had died on Thursday en route to Paris for medical treatment. French radio RFI said Buyoya had contracted COVID-19 in Mali and had been hospitalised there for a week. Malian government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The French foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority that held power in Burundi for decades after the country's 1962 independence from Belgium, was president for 13 years in total during two stints, from 1987-1993 and from 1996-2003. From 2012, Buyoya served as the African Union's envoy for Mali and the Sahel region. He resigned last month after his conviction in absentia at home. Buyoya first took power in 1987, ousting president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a military coup. In June, 1993, Buyoya left office after losing Burundi's first free election, to Melchior Ndadaye, a member of the Hutu majority.

2020-12-18,Reuters,"Tesla unlikely to drive up volatility on S&P 500, analysts say Investors have worried that including Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) notoriously volatile shares in the S&P 500 will exacerbate gyrations in the broader index, but some analysts say that's unlikely to happen.  The electric carmaker, which will join the S&P 500 on Monday after rallying nearly 700% this year, ranks near the highest in implied volatility - or expectations for stock moves embedded in options prices - on the index. Still, analysts say Tesla's shares will have a miniscule effect on broader market gyrations, based on past activity. If Tesla had been added to the S&P 500 on Thursday, it would have increased one-month implied volatility on the benchmark index by just 0.15 points, to 17.08 from 16.93, according to Susquehanna.  ""We do not think it is going to have a huge impact,"" said Christopher Murphy, Susquehanna's co-head of derivatives strategy. UBS strategist Stuart Kaiser concluded similarly regarding Tesla's effect on broader S&P 500 volatility in a research note distributed last month. Had the stock been included in the S&P 500 all year, it would have increased implied volatility on the benchmark index only by 0.12 points on average, he wrote. Meanwhile, by some measures, Tesla's options have shown greater calm recently. Tesla's 30-day implied volatility has dropped to about 82% from just below 95% last Friday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. Exuberance among buyers of Tesla options has also faded somewhat. Tesla's skew has turned positive in the past week, according to Trade Alert, showing that speculative demand for bullish call options on the carmaker has eased up in comparison to protective put options.

2020-12-17,Reuters,"GLOBAL MARKETS Stimulus hopes boost stocks to record; bitcoin soars World stocks scaled new peaks and oil marched higher on Thursday as investors lapped up risky assets on hopes of a U.S. fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep pumping cash into markets. From stocks to safe-haven gold and volatile bitcoin, financial assets were in festive mood. Bitcoin hit another all-time high after first shattering the $20,000 level on Wednesday. U.S. congressional negotiators were ""closing in on"" a $900 billion COVID-19 aid bill expected to include $600-$700 stimulus checks to individuals, lawmakers said on Wednesday. Such checks issued during Spring led to money pouring into stock markets and bitcoin from punters, helping stocks recover quickly from the COVID-19 blow. A trader in London pointed to chances of a new retail-led boost to stock markets. The general risk-on mood sent dollar to 2-1/2-year lows against major peers, while the MSCI world stock index (.MIWD00000PUS) reached a new high of 639.64. The index has climbed 16% since the end of October. Since then, multiple COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs have been announced. ""While we expect stocks to benefit further from positive news on vaccine rollouts and U.S. fiscal support, the same cannot be said for the US dollar,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""We see further (dollar) weakness ahead."" European stocks (.STOXX) and the euro rallied for the fourth straight session as investors built up positions in riskier assets, anticipating a sharp economic recovery in 2021 backed by wider vaccine rollouts and ultra-easy monetary policy.

2020-12-17,Reuters,"EU watchdog wants a more hands-on approach to insurer capital The European Union's capital rules for insurers need changing to reflect low interest rates and provide stronger intervention powers like banning dividends to preserve solvency during market shocks, the bloc's insurance watchdog said on Thursday. The EU is reviewing its Solvency II capital requirements for insurers in the bloc like Generali, Allianz and Axa that were introduced in 2016. ""EIOPA proposes changes in several areas but with balanced overall impact on insurers. This reflects the fact that Solvency II is overall working well,"" the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said in a statement. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note to clients that while headline capital ratios will be little changed, the ""sting in the tail"" is that regulators are increasing their flexibility to interfere in capital management decisions at insurers to levels well above the legal minimum. It will be up to the EU's executive European Commission to make proposals for legislative changes in the third quarter of next year, which would then need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. Extreme market volatility in March when economies went into pandemic lockdowns, and the impact on insurers of central banks slashing interest rates to negative territory in the euro zone, have shaped EIOPA's thinking. The watchdog said national supervisors in the EU27 should have powers to impose a capital surcharge on insurers to cover systemic risk, and to impose additional measures such as a ban on dividends to preserve an insurer's financial position. EIOPA called on insurers in April to suspend distributions to preserve capital during the pandemic, but Germany's regulators declined to fall in line. Insurance Europe, an industry body, said EIOPA's ""disappointing"" proposals would make the capital rules more conservative and create a less competitive sector. The review should focus on what needs fixing and not be an overhaul as proposed by EIOPA with its ""very extensive list"" of potential changes, Insurance Europe said.","Dec 17, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-watchdog-wants-more-hands-on-approach-insurer-capital-2020-12-17/

Ant has ""voluntarily removed"" the online deposit products from Alipay ""in accordance with the recent regulatory requirements for online deposits services,"" according to a company statement. The removal will not impact existing individuals who have already deposited money with banks via Alipay, it added. The financial arms of big tech companies including JD Digits, Didi Chuxing and Baidu Inc's Du Xiaoman Financial have been offering high-yield deposits at local banks on its apps. China's regulators have warned the country's big tech giants that they face closer scrutiny. A planned $37 billion stock listing of Ant Group was suspended in November after the regulatory warning. Regulators have recently said local lenders attracting deposits nationwide with the help of internet platforms are violating regulatory rules that limit smaller city banks to drawing business from their home market. The products may also encourage high interest rates on deposits, thus lifting costs for banks and intensifying the liquidity crunch of smaller lenders, Sun Tianqi, head of the financial stability bureau at the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said at a forum this week, according to local newspaper the 21st Business Herald. ""The proxy sales of bank deposit products on third-party internet financial platforms are illegal financial activities, and are like 'driving without a license',"" Sun said, adding that such business should be included in the PBOC's financial supervision framework.

2020-12-17,Reuters,"EU court backs broader definition of tools to rig vehicle emissions tests Technologies used by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) to rig vehicle emissions tests should be considered illegal, the European Union's highest court ruled on Thursday, even if they contribute to preventing ageing or clogging up of the engine. The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to rule in a French prosecution against the carmaker for allegedly deceiving purchasers of diesel vehicles. Volkswagen had argued in favour of a restrictive definition of devices used to rig emissions tests, limited to technologies and strategies operating only ""downstream"", or after potential emissions are produced.  However, the court found that the term should also apply to ""upstream"" technology. Use of so-called defeat devices to help a vehicle pass emissions tests is illegal under EU law. The French case concerned an exhaust gas recirculation (ERG) valve, which can redirect some exhaust gases back into the air supply for the engine to reduce final NOx emissions. The ERG was adjusted in tests using a device to allow emissions to remain below the regulatory ceiling, but according to an expert's report the device would in normal conditions lead to the partial deactivation of the ERG and higher NOx emissions. Operation of the ERG would have made maintenance more frequent and expensive because, for example, the engine would clog up more quickly. Volkswagen announced recalls of almost 950,000 vehicles in France following the ""dieselgate"" scandal in which it admitted in 2015 to using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests.  The scandal has cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions.","Dec 17, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-court-backs-broader-definition-tools-rig-vehicle-emissions-tests-2020-12-17/

2020-12-17,Reuters,"Global coal demand to rise 2.6% in 2021 after record decline this year -IEA Global demand for coal is set to jump 2.6% next year after a record pandemic-led drop this year, as recovering economic activity will lift use for electricity and industrial output, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday. Demand for thermal and metallurgical coal should rise to 7,432 million tonnes in 2021, from 7,243 million tonnes this year, the Paris-based agency said in its Coal 2020 report. Global coal demand fell by 5% this year as the impact of the pandemic curbed usage, IEA said.  Between 2018 and 2020, global coal demand will have fallen by an unprecedented 7%, or 500 million tonnes, the agency said, due to the pandemic and as countries around the world seek to shift to cleaner sources of energy. ""Before the pandemic, we expected a small rebound in coal demand in 2020, but we have since witnessed the largest drop in coal consumption since the Second World War,"" IEA's director of energy markets and security, Keisuke Sadamori, said in a statement.  While even the United States and Europe could see their first increases in coal consumption in nearly a decade next year, demand in 2021 would still trail 2019 levels and the IEA expected coal use to flatten out by 2025 at around 7.4 billion tonnes. Renewables would likely surpass coal as the largest global source of electricity by 2025, while natural gas would take coal's place as the second largest primary energy source after oil, Sadamori said. ""But with coal demand still expected to remain steady or to grow in key Asian economies, there is no sign that coal is going to fade away quickly,"" he added, with key Asian markets accounting for 75% of global coal demand. Coal is a key driver of CO2 emissions and governments around the globe have pledged carbon neutrality in the next decades, including China, which has set its target for before 2060. The IEA said it would need to review its 2025 coal demand forecast, once the Chinese government releases its economic plans for 2021-2025, due in March.","Dec 17, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/global-coal-demand-rise-26-2021-after-record-decline-this-year-iea-2020-12-18/

The probe landed in the northern region of Inner Mongolia in the early hours of Thursday, bringing back the first lunar rocks and soil retrieved by any country since the 1970s and making China the third country ever to obtain lunar samples. The material collected during the Chang'e-5 mission, named after the mythical Chinese goddess of the moon, will further scientists' understanding of the moon's origins.

Transport Canada rolled out its plans for bringing the jets back to the country's skies, first reported by Reuters on Wednesday, following a near two-year flight ban. The regulator joined U.S. and European authorities in insisting on additional pilot training and a software update to the MCAS anti-stall system that contributed to the two crashes which killed a total of 346 people in 2018 and 2019. Canada's decision is widely watched as it carries extra clout as one of a group of aircraft-producing nations that have subjected the MAX to intense scrutiny, alongside the United States, Europe and Brazil. Attention now turns to China, the largest market for the MAX and a rising aerospace-producing nation which has not said when it will grant approval to resume flights. Transport Canada's plans follow earlier announcements by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with Boeing's main regulator, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which lifted its own ban on Nov. 18. Canada's approval of design changes marks the first step in the aircraft's return to service in Canada, which the regulator said would require a Canadian airworthiness directive in January and an interim order on training. ""It's possible that after January, once the planes have been modified and the pilots and everybody are trained on the procedures, we will allow the MAX to fly,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters.  Investigations into the crashes of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights pointed to Boeing's poor systems design as a contributing factor and criticized the FAA for lax oversight of the planemaker. Ottawa has held its own hearings on aircraft certification. Some family members of crash victims have called for an investigation citing concerns the Canadian regulator was too close to the FAA when it first allowed the jet to fly in Canada.  Transport Canada and EASA have diverged from the FAA on certain requirements for crew training.","Dec 17, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canada-expects-end-boeing-737-max-flight-ban-january-approves-design-changes-2020-12-17/

2020-12-17,Reuters,"Real thing or placebo? My COVID-19 vaccine odyssey continues The subject line on the email I received last week said simply, ""Test."" It contained the results of a private blood test I had undergone the day before. I opened the attachment with excitement and some trepidation - I believed it would likely reveal whether I am already vaccinated against COVID-19, or if I received a placebo. As a volunteer in a late-stage clinical trial for an experimental vaccine for COVID-19, I had already received two injections. I knew when I signed up there was a 50-50 chance I'd either get a vaccine made by an American company called Novavax – or a salt-water solution used as a control to see if the real thing works. A friend joked that might protect me against drowning, but nothing else. I experienced no symptoms after the first shot, which I received in late October. But immediately following the second injection three weeks later, there was mild swelling where the needle had pierced my upper right arm. A small, pink circle quickly formed around it. A nurse carefully measured the redness and took notes. Two doctors were called in to take a look. They eventually sent me home and asked me to contact the clinic if I experienced any pain or signs that it had become infected. That didn't happen. Two weeks later, I returned to the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London for a scheduled blood test. I showed a doctor how the skin around the injection site was still black and blue. ""Looks like you got the real thing,"" he said, to my surprise. He noted that several other volunteers had experienced similar symptoms, although he added it was still possible I had received the placebo. As it happened, that morning the United Kingdom became the first western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine. It is made by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech, which have reported that it was 95% effective in clinical trials. It has since been authorized for use in several other countries, including the United States. My feelings about the doctor's comment were mixed. While the Novavax vaccine is considered very promising based on early results, its efficacy isn't expected to be known until early next year. Who knows how effective it'll be? Yet knowing I might already be protected against a potentially deadly virus seemed a relief. For starters, I might finally feel safe enough to visit the wonderful pub behind my house for the first time in nine months - wearing a mask, of course. To be honest, part of me had been secretly hoping that I had received the placebo. I had asked when my trial started what would happen if another vaccine was approved first. The doctor in charge had strongly suggested that I'd be told what I'd been injected with - a process known as ""unblinding."" I could then get the approved vaccine – provided I had received the placebo. But if I had received the actual Novavax vaccine, he said, it could be risky because receiving two vaccines targeting the same disease could cause a reaction.","Dec 17, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/real-thing-or-placebo-my-covid-19-vaccine-odyssey-continues-2020-12-17/

U.S.-Chinese ties have rapidly deteriorated this year over a range of issues, from Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, U.S. support for Taiwan, China's clampdown on Hong Kong and rows over Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL]. The United States has also long opposed China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway. Admiral Phil Davidson, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said in a statement on Wednesday that China's no-show for the scheduled meetings ""should serve as a reminder to all nations as they pursue agreements with China going forward"". China had been due to participate in Dec. 14-16 meetings related to the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA) focused on maritime safety, the U.S. command said.

2020-12-16,Reuters,"Bitcoin shatters $20,000 barrier for first time Bitcoin  smashed through $20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, its highest ever, amid increased institutional and corporate interest. The cryptocurrencyhit an all-time peak of $20,800 and was last up 6.4% at $20,675 . It has gained more than 170% this year, buoyed by demand from larger investors attracted to its potential for quick gains, purported resistance to inflation and expectations it will become a mainstream payment method. Smaller coins ethereum  and XRP , which often move in tandem with bitcoin, gained 5.4% and 8.1%, respectively. ""Many of our clients have been expecting bitcoin to surpass its all-time high of $20,000 given the recent news from major institutional players like SGX and MassMutual openly endorsing bitcoin,"" said Scott Freeman, co-founder & partner at trading firm JST Capital. ""While this is a major milestone for this nascent asset class, as retail, institutional, and blue-chip investors alike allocate more capital to this space, it would not be surprising to see other coins follow in BTC's footsteps and for this upward trajectory to be sustained into 2021."" Bitcoin's blistering rally has seen a massive flow of coin to North America from East Asia, fuelled by hunger for bitcoin among bigger and compliance-wary U.S. investors. British fund manager Ruffer Investment Management, which managed 20.3 billion pounds ($27.3 billion) in assets at end-November, made a bet on bitcoin now worth around 550 million pounds ($745 million), a spokesman for the company told Reuters. The rally in bitcoin, which some investors have seen as a potential safe haven, has coincided with spot gold's  drop in recent months. Some investors such as hedge funds and family offices have in the past been deterred by the opaque nature of the crypto market. Tightening oversight of the American crypto industry has helped soothe some of those concerns.  After touching a record high just under $20,000 in late November, bitcoin stalled and even went below $17,000, stoking fears that it would be a repeat of the asset's collapse in 2018.","Dec 16, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bitcoin-shatters-20000-barrier-first-time-2020-12-16/

The lackluster debut comes after mega-IPOs and stellar first-day pops of companies including Airbnb Inc (ABNB.O), DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) and SnowFlake Inc (SNOW.N). ContextLogic was founded in 2010 by Chief Executive Peter Szulczewski, formerly of Google, and Yahoo veteran Danny Zhang.

""We are investing in logistics, scaling the team on a global basis, looking for new revenue streams and improving our customer experience, which is more like (social media app) TikTok for shopping,"" Szulczewski said in an interview. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping as consumers stayed at home, but also brought disruption to supply chains. In July-September, Wish booked $606 million in revenue, up 33%, and a net loss of $99 million. The company is expanding local warehouses to better control shipping times and bundling orders to cut shipping costs for the 2 million products sold per day.

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, resembles an antitrust complaint filed earlier in the day by Texas and nine other U.S. states against Google.  Genius, which provides song lyrics, and two online magazines the Nation and the Progressive, said they used Google software to sell ads but received what they viewed as an unfair split of sales because the search giant had taken over the market. ""Through its campaign of anticompetitive conduct, Google has achieved and maintained a monopoly or near-monopoly in (the) marketplace by erecting a toll bridge between publishers and advertisers and charging an unlawfully high price for passage,"" the lawsuit stated. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company repeatedly has responded to similar accusations by saying that Facebook Inc (FB.O) and other companies offer competitive services to media companies. The plaintiffs ask the court to order Google to divest its unit that makes the ad-selling software and refrain from competing in that business. They also seek punitive damages. The complaint is the latest among several antitrust actions brought against Google by online advertisers or other businesses that say they have been affected by Google's growing clout. The Texas-led lawsuit covers many of their concerns, too, and separately at least 36 states plan to sue Google on Thursday over additional anticompetitive conduct on the web.

2020-12-16,Reuters,"Biden's expected Energy Department pick, Granholm, could lead charge on electric cars When Jennifer Granholm was governor of auto-manufacturing Michigan, she led a charge that secured a whopping $1.35 billion in federal funding for companies to make electric cars and batteries in her state.  As President-elect Joe Biden's expected energy secretary, Granholm now faces a bigger task: making good on his campaign promise to help the United States compete with China on electric vehicles (EVs) as part of a $2 trillion plan to fight climate change. Biden has said China was set to dramatically outpace the United States in EV production. But the United States, he said after the Nov. 3 election, could ""own"" the market with the right green policies. He has promised to build 550,000 EV charging stations and create over 1 million jobs by investing in clean energy research.  His transition team did not respond to a request for comment on how Granholm, who sources said on Tuesday would be nominated by Biden, would push EVs.  To do so, Biden's administration will need to coax a closely divided Congress to approve tax credits and billions of dollars more in stimulus funding. The Democratic president-elect takes office on Jan. 20. Joe Britton, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, was optimistic that Granholm, who got green initiatives done in Rust-Belt Michigan, could make a difference.  ""If we cultivate the electric vehicle sector, we can create hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs and Governor Granholm has been a key advocate in driving that economic development,"" he said.

2020-12-16,Reuters,"EU chief says UK trade pact closer but success not certain Britain and the European Union have moved closer to sealing a new trade deal but it was still unclear if they would succeed, the bloc's chief executive said on Wednesday. Britain and the EU are in the final stretch of talks to keep an estimated one trillion dollars of annual trade free of tariffs and quotas beyond Dec. 31, when the United Kingdom finally transitions out of the world's largest trading bloc.  With just over two weeks left, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the EU would ""see sense"" and agree a deal that respected Britain's sovereignty, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the bloc favoured agreement. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament: ""I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. But I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow but it is there.""  Her relatively upbeat comments on the long-running Brexit crisis helped nudge sterling upwards on currency markets. However, von der Leyen also said two issues were still unsolved. ""We have found a way forward on most issues but two issues still remain outstanding: the level playing field and fisheries,"" she said. ""Issues linked to governance now have largely been resolved. The next days are going to be decisive."" The level playing field refers to EU insistence that Britain does not undercut it on environmental, labour and social standards, as well as state aid, while governance covers the resolution of disputes. Von der Leyen said discussions about access to UK fishing waters for EU vessels were still very difficult. Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31 but has been in a transition period since then under which rules on trade, travel and business remain unchanged. It finally exits the bloc's single market and customs union on Dec. 31. Failure to agree a deal would erect trade barriers between the EU and Britain, snarl borders, send shockwaves through financial markets and cause chaos in supply chains across Europe as it also struggles with COVID-19.","Dec 16, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-chief-says-uk-trade-pact-closer-success-not-certain-2020-12-16/

The position would give her authority over a department that employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees more than 20% of federal land, including national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite.  She has told Reuters she would seek to usher in an expansion of renewable energy production on federal land to contribute to the fight against climate change, and undo President Donald Trump's focus on bolstering fossil fuels output. Two of the sources said that Biden's team is close to finalizing the decision on Haaland, but are weighing concerns about the loss of a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats are hanging on to a slim majority.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"Biden hits campaign trail in Georgia after top Republicans acknowledge his win Hours after speaking with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and vowing to try to work together, President-elect Joe Biden urged Georgians on Tuesday to oust McConnell as majority leader by electing the two Democratic candidates in Jan. 5 Senate runoffs. In a speech that marked his return to the campaign trail a day after the Electoral College confirmed his Nov. 3 election victory, Biden, a Democrat, laid out the stakes of the twin contests in no uncertain terms, warning that leaving the Senate in Republican hands could threaten much of his policy agenda. ""Are you ready to vote for two senators who know how to say yes and not just no?"" Biden told an Atlanta drive-in rally, where attendees remained in their cars because of the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are challenging Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively. A Democratic sweep would give the party control of both chambers of Congress as well as the White House, while even one Republican win would allow McConnell to block many of Biden's legislative goals. Earlier on Tuesday, McConnell broke with Republican President Donald Trump and congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for the first time from the Senate floor. Trump has refused to concede, even as his myriad efforts to overturn the results have met with failure.  McConnell and his top deputies pressed other Senate Republicans not to join with any House Republicans who may object to the election outcome when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to ratify the decision. Any such effort to challenge the results is all but certain to fail since it would require approval by both chambers, including the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives Biden told reporters he and McConnell agreed to meet soon to discuss potential areas of cooperation. During the campaign event, he made clear, however, the limits of that partnership, telling Georgians a Democratic Senate was necessary to make progress on coronavirus relief, funding for testing and vaccine distribution, aid to state and local governments, climate change and criminal justice. He also attacked Loeffler and Perdue for embracing a lawsuit filed by Texas and supported by Trump that sought to invalidate the election results in Georgia and three other states that went for Biden. The U.S. Supreme Court summarily dismissed the case on Friday.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"Zoom to set up R&D centre and hire hundreds of engineers in Singapore Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) said on Wednesday it would expand its presence in Singapore by opening a research and development centre and will immediately hire hundreds of engineering staff for the new operations.     The video-conferencing services provider said in a statement that is also doubling its data centre capacity in the country. The San Jose, California-based company launched the Singapore data centre, its first in Southeast Asia, in August. The company has seen a surge in users of its video conferencing service this year, with millions of workers and students using its video platform as they work and study from home due to the coronavirus-led lockdowns. ""We plan to immediately hire employees,"" Velchamy Sankarlingam, president of product and engineering for Zoom, said while floating the company's expansion plans.  Zoom said it would select the location for its new centre as pandemic-related remote-work mode subsides, adding to its existing R&D centers in the United States, India, and China.     Singapore in recent years has been ramping up its efforts to lure firms related to technology - including global players such as Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O), and Chinese tech giants Tencent (0700.HK) and Alibaba (9988.HK) - a sector it hopes will power the city-state's economic growth. Last month, the low-tax global business hub announced a new work visa for foreign executives of technology firms, even as it tightens broader immigration curbs to try and assuage fears over competition for jobs due to rising unemployment.     Zoom has previously said its hiring plans for Singapore would include engineers and sales staff. The company said it has more than 3,800 employees globally, but did not provide a headcount for its Singapore operations.  While the share price has climbed about 500% in 2020, Zoom warned last month that margins would remain under pressure next year as its high number of free users makes it hard to offset a spike in costs to maintain growth.

The investigation has focused on two of the three top Trafigura directors, Co-head of Oil Trading Jose Larocca and Chief Operating Officer Mike Wainwright. The criminal probe is advancing alongside a civil lawsuit against the same executives and others disclosed this month, the people said.  Brazilian investigators have also shared findings with U.S. prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the case is classified.  The decision to pursue both civil and criminal cases shows Brazilian prosecutors are emboldened by the $164 million settlement with oil trader Vitol in a separate bribery case. Vitol Inc will pay the U.S. and Brazil to settle claims it paid more than $8 million in bribes to win contracts at Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), as the state firm is formally called. Neither Larocca nor Wainwright have been charged.  The two did not reply to requests for comment. Trafigura said it had hired law firm Quinn Emanuel to review the allegations of improper payments involving Petrobras. ""Based on its review to date, which is ongoing, Quinn Emanuel believes any allegations that current management were involved in, or had knowledge of, alleged improper payments to Petrobras are unsupported by the evidence and untrue."" The probes in Brazil have been advanced by information provided by Trafigura's former board member and Brazil chief, Mariano Ferraz, who admitted paying bribes for more than a decade and in May signed a cooperation agreement. U.S. investigators interviewed Ferraz earlier this year, sources said.  Ferraz told prosecutors that Larocca and Wainwright approved bribes to win hundreds of fuel oil contracts, according to court documents unsealed this month. Ferraz agreed to cooperate in exchange for reduced penalties.  The evidence includes hundreds of pages of bank records and e-mails seized from people who are collaborating with authorities.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"Sweden failed to protect elderly in COVID pandemic, commission finds Sweden failed to protect elderly people during the pandemic with the high level of community spread likely the biggest factor as the coronavirus ravaged ill-prepared nursing homes, an initial report by an official commission said on Tuesday. Sweden's pandemic strategy, shunning lockdowns and masks,  has stood out internationally. It left schools, restaurants and businesses largely open while appealing to people to socially distance and maintain good hygiene. When announced during the spring, the strategy was coupled with a goal to ""ring-fence"" the elderly from COVID-19. But as deaths mounted, above all at nursing homes, the commission was appointed to asses the response.  In the commission's first findings, it said the overall spread and previously known structural problems within the elderly care system, for which the current and previous governments were ultimately responsible, were to blame for the many deaths. ""These shortcomings meant that elderly care was unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic,"" the commission said in a statement. ""The employees in elderly care were largely left alone to handle the crisis situation."" The strategy has been called reckless and cruel but also won praise from people seeing it as more sustainable and business-friendly. Just under half of Sweden's almost 7,700 deaths have been nursing home residents. The commission also said measures by the government and governmental agencies to protect the elderly during the spring had come too late. ""We also asses that the measures were insufficient in several respects,"" it added. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has defended the overall strategy but admitted Sweden failed to shield the elderly, though stressing health and elderly care are the responsibility of regional authorities and not the central government.  In November, Sweden's Health and Social Care Inspectorate said it had found ""serious shortcomings"" in elderly care - in only 6% of cases reviewed were nursing home COVID-19 patients given a physical examination by a doctor. Sweden has suffered many times more deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, although fewer than some European countries that opted for lockdowns.","Dec 15, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/sweden-failed-protect-elderly-covid-pandemic-commission-finds-2020-12-15/

Canadian police arrested Nygard in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Monday at the U.S. government's request under the countries' extradition treaty. Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said Nygard, 79, had since 1995 used his influence and businesses to ""recruit and maintain"" victims in the United States, Canada and the Bahamas to sexually gratify himself and his associates. “Mr. Nygard vehemently denies all the allegations and expects to be vindicated in court,"" his lawyer Jay Prober said.

Born in Finland, Nygard grew up in Manitoba, eventually running his own namesake clothing companies and becoming one of Canada's wealthiest people.

Some Cenovus investors were apprehensive about the deal as they believed that the addition of Husky's refineries would hinder the company from taking advantage of rising oil prices.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"WRAPUP 2 U.S. manufacturing production solid; imported inflation muted U.S. manufacturing output increased more than expected in November, boosted by motor vehicle production, though momentum could slow as a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 infections keeps workers at home and temporarily shuts down factories. Other data on Tuesday suggested that a benign inflation environment could persist for a while, with import prices barely rising last month even as the dollar has weakened against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.  Strong production at factories is defying signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the coronavirus recession, underscored by rising layoffs. Retail sales likely declined in November for the first time since April, according to a Reuters survey of economists. November's retail sales report is scheduled to be released on Wednesday. ""COVID-19 containment measures are likely to exert a heavy economic toll over the next few months and the manufacturing sector won't be immune, but it is going to be far less directly impacted than consumer services in big cities,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. Manufacturing output rose 0.8% last month after surging 1.1% in October, the Federal Reserve said. Factory production remains 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level. Economists had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.3% in November. Motor vehicle production rebounded 5.3% after declining for three straight months. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output increased 0.4% after surging 1.3% in October.  A shift in demand from services to goods during the pandemic is underpinning manufacturing's recovery. But the relentless crisis also poses a risk. The Institute for Supply Management early this month reported a dip in business sentiment in November, with manufacturers saying the resurgence in coronavirus infections was straining suppliers and that production lines were being shut down due to lack of staff.  The ISM warned that absenteeism at factories and their suppliers as well as difficulties in returning and hiring workers would continue to ""dampen"" manufacturing until the pandemic ended.    Fed officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Policymakers are expected to keep interest rates near zero and deliver a playbook for what might prompt them to pump more money into the economy.  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"New coronavirus strain spreading in UK has key mutations, scientists say British scientists are trying to establish whether the rapid spread in southern England of a new variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 is linked to key mutations they have detected in the strain, they said on Tuesday. The mutations include changes to the important ""spike"" protein that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus uses to infect human cells, a group of scientists tracking the genetics of the virus said, but it is not yet clear whether these are making it more infectious.  ""Efforts are under way to confirm whether or not any of these mutations are contributing to increased transmission,"" the scientists, from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, said in a statement. The new variant, which UK scientists have named ""VUI – 202012/01"" includes a genetic mutation in the ""spike"" protein, which - in theory - could result in COVID-19 spreading more easily between people. The British government on Monday cited a rise in new infections, which it said may be partly linked to the new variant, as it moved its capital city and many other areas into the highest tier of COVID-19 restrictions.  As of Dec. 13, 1,108 COVID-19 cases with the new variant had been identified, predominantly in the south and east of England, Public Health England said in a statement. But there is currently no evidence that the variant is more likely to cause severe COVID-19 infections, the scientists said, or that it would render vaccines less effective.

2020-12-15,Reuters,"Fleeing New Yorkers resulted in an estimated $34 bln in lost income -study Millions of people have moved out of New York City during the pandemic, but at the same time, millions of others with lower incomes have taken their place, according to a study released on Tuesday.  All told, a net 70,000 people left the metropolitan region this year, resulting in roughly $34 billion in lost income, according to estimates from Unacast, a location analytics company. About 3.57 million people left New York City this year between Jan. 1 and Dec. 7, according to Unacast, which analyzed anonymized cell phone location data. Some 3.5 million people earning lower average incomes moved into the city during that same period, the report showed.  ""The exodus isn't as big as people have been talking about,"" said Thomas Walle, chief executive and co-founder of Unacast. ""Maybe the greater impact is how the population is changing and how the demographics are changing."" In Tribeca, a wealthy neighborhood in downtown Manhattan, residents who left this year earned an average income of about $140,000, Walle said. The typical person moving into the neighborhood earned an average $82,000, he said.  The dual hit to population and income across the city can have lasting consequences for New York City as it recovers from the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, Walle said. ""The big question is, 'How does real estate and retail in particular adapt to that?'"" he said.  In the longer run, the changing demographics could lead to  more affordable brands taking the place of higher-end stores, the researchers noted. At the same time, real estate developers may need to offer more lower-priced housing options, Walle said.  A separate report released earlier this year by StreetEasy found that vacancies rose and rents dropped  between February and July in high-end neighborhoods, including the financial district downtown. But rents continued to rise in more affordable neighborhoods.    ","Dec 15, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/fleeing-new-yorkers-resulted-an-estimated-34-bln-lost-income-study-2020-12-15/
2020-12-14,Reuters,"Kuwait names new oil and finance ministers as government Kuwait's emir on Monday approved a new cabinet that included new ministers of oil and finance for the OPEC member state which is mired in its worst economic crisis in decades. The previous government had resigned following parliamentary polls this month in which opposition candidates made gains and around two thirds of lawmakers lost their seats. A priority of the new government will be to boost state coffers badly hit by the coronavirus crisis and low oil prices, including by trying to end legislative deadlock over a bill that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets. The government communications office said Khalifa Hamade was named finance minister. He was a former undersecretary at the ministry. Mohammad Abdulatif al-Fares, who sits on the board of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, was named oil, electricity and water minister.  Kuwait's oil policy, which is set by a supreme petroleum council, and foreign policy, which is steered by the emir, are unlikely to change under the new 15-member government.  The Gulf Arab state's economy, which is worth nearly $140 billion, is facing a deficit of $46 billion this year.  Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who took the reins in September following the death of his brother, has reappointed Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah as prime minister. Sheikh Sabah, who took the oath of office in front of the emir on Monday, called for united efforts ""and especially by the National Assembly"" to address challenges facing Kuwait. Kuwait, a U.S. ally, has the most open political system in the Gulf region, with a parliament wielding power to pass legislation and question ministers, although senior posts are occupied by ruling family members.","Dec 14, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/kuwait-names-new-oil-finance-ministers-government-faces-liquidity-crunch-2020-12-14/

The greenback was near its weakest since mid-2018 versus the riskier Aussie and kiwi dollars in early Asian trading with U.S. lawmakers scurrying to ready $1.4 trillion in spending. A $908 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief plan will be split into two packages, a person briefed on the matter said, raising hopes that at least a large part of the plan that already has bipartisan support will be approved.  Across the Atlantic, European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that sealing a trade pact with Britain was still possible, sowing hope that a deal can be reached with just days to avert a turbulent exit for the UK from the trade bloc at the end of the month.  The British pound was little changed against the dollar at $1.3332 , after rising 0.8% on Monday. It reached a 2 1/2-year high of $1.3540 earlier this month. The greenback slipped 0.1% to $1.2150 per euro , trading near a 2 1/2-year low of $1.2177 touched again on Monday. COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs in the U.S. and UK also buoyed risk sentiment, but optimism was tempered by spikes in infection and death rates.

2020-12-14,Reuters,"Pandemic nudging firms to address climate change, says Norway wealth fund The coronavirus pandemic may be accelerating a shift among companies worldwide to make their operations more environmentally sustainable, a high-ranking official at Norway's $1.25 trillion sovereign wealth fund said on Monday. The fund is one of the world's largest investors, channelling revenues from Norway's oil and gas production into the stocks of some 9,200 companies abroad, or 1.5% of the world's stocks. It also holds bonds and unlisted real estate. ""The pandemic has not weakened sustainability work, but perhaps strengthened it,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's head of governance and compliance, told a news conference, citing a survey the fund had done among a sample of firms it invests in. Some 67% of 1,521 companies it surveyed in 2020 said they had set long-term quantitative targets to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, up from 54% in 2019, when 1,500 firms were surveyed. Some 48% of companies surveyed in 2020 had considered different climate scenarios in their business plans or strategy, up from 35% in 2019, the fund said. ""The head of a big European company told us that the pandemic has accelerated work on sustainability,"" Smith Ihenacho said. She did not name the firm or the executive. She did not spell out why the pandemic was making more companies more inclined to sustainable operations. Still, a majority of companies surveyed this year - 52% - has not considered different climate scenarios in their business plan or strategy.      The fund is canvassing companies because it wants to test the business model of the biggest CO2 emitters in its portfolio and see whether they have a business model that can survive in a low-carbon society. The fund had previously said it was planning to publish, ahead of time, its voting intentions at the annual general meetings of the 9,200 companies it invests in.

2020-12-14,Reuters,"U.S. court hears appeal challenging order blocking TikTok app store ban A U.S. appeals court on Monday questioned a government lawyer over the Trump administration's efforts to ban Americans from downloading Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington on Sept. 27 blocked the Commerce Department order hours before it was to prohibit new downloads of the short video-sharing app.   The ban would have required Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) to remove the app from their stores, preventing new users from downloading it or existing users downloading updated versions. It would not have stopped existing users from accessing the app on their devices.  Appeals Court Judges Judith Rogers, Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins questioned lawyers for TikTok and the government for nearly 90 minutes on Monday morning. All three judges were nominated by previous Democratic presidents. On Dec. 4, the Trump administration opted not to grant TikTok-owner ByteDance a new extension of an order requiring the company to divest TikTok's U.S. assets. A lawyer for TikTok, Beth Brinkmann, said during the court hearing there are ""ongoing talks"" over the app's fate. President Donald Trump's order, issued in August, gave the Justice Department the power to enforce the divestiture order once the deadline expired. But over a week has passed and the department has not gone to court seeking to compel divestiture. The administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China's government. TikTok, which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegation. Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity aimed to satisfy the divestiture order. On Dec. 7, Judge Nichols separately granted a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on TikTok that would have effectively barred its use in the United States. Nichols issued an order in a suit filed by ByteDance after U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania earlier blocked the same restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12.

Currency markets were dominated by news that London and Brussels had agreed to ""go the extra mile"" to try to salvage a Brexit trade agreement, lifting the British pound and euro against the struggling dollar.  Progress on coronavirus vaccines boosted sentiment, with the first doses shipped across the United States as part of an effort to inoculate more than 100 million people by the end of March.  However, some traders noted that optimism about the vaccine had already been factored in, limiting upside for investors.

""This market is 100% relying on this vaccine"". Second waves of the pandemic forced Germany, the Netherlands and London back into stricter lockdowns.

Administration of the vaccine developed by Pfizer (PFE.N) and its German partner BioNTech  began on Monday, after the shot received emergency-use approval from federal regulators last week.

The company's shares were down 13% as of 1020 GMT, extending their losses from last week amid mixed reception of the game. Cyberpunk, a futuristic role-playing game featuring Hollywood star Keanu Reeves, is rated an average of 2.8 out of 10 at a review aggregator website Metacritic for its version on Sony's (6758.T) PlayStation 4, while Microsoft's (MSFT.O) XBox One version has a score of 3.7. Jefferies analysts have also pointed to reports of refunds offered by both Sony and Microsoft for digital purchases of the game. The company said it would hold a call with analysts at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) and offered no further comment. Kacper Kopron, analyst at TRIGON DM brokerage, estimates sales of the game's version on older consoles could account for one-third of its total expected sales volumes over the game's life cycle. CD Projekt should now focus on repairing its communication with the gamers, Kopron added. Vladimir Bespalov from VTB Capital said the scores on consoles were ""disappointing"", but the game's better performance on platforms suggested redistribution of sales to next year and he kept his forecast of 33 million units sold by end 2021. Cyberpunk took eight years to develop and its debut had been pushed back three times as the company kept working on optimising it for old and new consoles.

The rules are the most serious attempt by the 27-country bloc to rein in the power of the U.S. tech giants which control troves of data and online platforms on which thousands of companies and millions of Europeans rely on. They also mark the European Commission's frustration with its antitrust cases against the tech giants, notably Google, which critics say did not address the problem. Regulatory scrutiny has been growing worldwide of tech giants and their power. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton will present the rules, a bid not just to rein in tech giants but also to prevent the emergence of anti-competitive dominant companies. One set of rules called the Digital Markets Act calls for fines up to 10% of annual turnover for online gatekeepers found breaching the new rules, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. It also sets out a list of dos and don'ts for gatekeepers, which will be classified according to criteria such as number of users, revenues and the number of markets in which they are active, other sources said. The second set of rules known as the Digital Services Act also targets very large online platforms as those with more than 45 million users. They will be required to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms, misuse of their platforms that infringe fundamental rights and intentional manipulation of platforms to influence elections and public health, among others.

More than 200,000 people have already been vaccinated against the disease as part of Russia's mass inoculation programme, which began in September alongside a Moscow-based human trial of the shot.  The new results are based on data from 22,714 participants in the trial, and were published after 78 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported among the group, researchers at the Gamaleya Institute said in a statement on Monday with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is marketing the shot abroad.  Of the 78 cases, 62 occurred among participants who received a placebo, the researchers said, while in the trial overall the ratio of those who received the placebo to those vaccinated was 1 to 3. Twenty of the infected participants who received a placebo suffered severe symptoms of COVID-19, the statement said. There were no severe cases among the 16 vaccinated trial participants, the statement said. Analysis of the new data found Sputnik V, named after the Soviet satellite that triggered the space race, to have a 91.4% efficacy rate, the statement said.  The results, described as a ""final control point"" in the trial, were identical to interim results published on Nov. 24, based on 39 cases among trial participants, that also found the shot to be 91.4% effective.

Groups run by North Korean defectors and other campaigners have for decades sent anti-Pyongyang leaflets - alongside food, medicine, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and dramas - into the North, usually by balloon or in bottles on border rivers. North Korea has long denounced the practice. The amendment to the Development of Inter-Korean Relations Act bars any scattering of printed materials, goods, money and other items of value across the heavily fortified frontier.  It also restricts loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South's military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 inter-Korean summit.  Any violation of the law, which will take effect in three months, is punishable by up to three years in prison or 30 million won ($27,500) in fines.  The change was approved despite filibuster efforts from opposition lawmakers to block the super-majority of the ruling party of President Moon Jae-in, who is keen to improve cross-border ties.  CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE The bill was introduced in June by ruling party lawmakers after Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, warned Seoul should enact a law to stop leaflets or face the ""worst phase"" of relations. ""They were trying to put Kim Yo Jong's order into law at her single word,"" Tae Yong-ho, an opposition lawmaker and former North Korean diplomat, said in his 10-hour filibuster speech, adding the bill would only help Kim's government continue ""enslaving"" its people.

Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) took delivery of approximately 216,000 barrels of naphtha, a product used as a solvent as well as a raw material for conversion to gasoline, in Beaumont, Texas,  on Monday, according to the data and source. The refinery, located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, is still struggling to bring certain units online that are necessary for production of cleaner fuels such as gasoline and diesel.     A spokeswoman from Limetree Bay declined to comment. BP did not respond to a request for comment.  The refinery's owner, Limetree Bay Ventures, has spent at least $2.7 billion on the restart, hoping to tap rising demand for low-sulfur fuels and markets in Latin America and the Caribbean. Its goal is to process about 210,000 barrels of crude per day, but the COVID-19 pandemic has crushed refining margins globally. The refinery faced numerous delays with restart. BP agreed to supply the refinery's crude and market the fuels produced in anticipation of a late 2019 startup. However, BP could terminate that contract if the plant cannot reach a certain production target by year-end, the people said. The refinery had been idled since 2012, an unusually long period of time for a plant of its size and complexity to be idled before restarting under new ownership. Limetree owners EIG Global Energy Partners and Arclight Capital Partners embarked on the overhaul in expectation of a surge in demand for marine fuels that complies with new maritime rules for low sulfur content.

Langer was still keen on Burns taking the role and he would be watched closely at training over the next two days. There was no suggestion that Marnus Labuschange would be elevated from his usual number three position, though Matthew Wade could be used as a makeshift opener, Langer added. ""He's got good footwork. He's got the game for it,"" Langer said of the former wicketkeeper who has been batting in the middle order in the test side. ""He can counterattack like David Warner does and a lot of the great openers do.

2020-12-14,Reuters,"Airbus urges compromises on Brexit, transatlantic tariffs The head of European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) called on Monday for an end to separate diplomatic squabbles over Britain's exit from the European Union and a transatlantic aircraft subsidy dispute that collectively overshadow its business. Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said Airbus - whose manufacturing plants straddle Britain and the EU - was preparing for disruption if Britain completes its exit from the bloc without a deal, but downplayed warnings of severe upheaval.  ""It would really be a pity that after so many years of preparation there is no deal at the end. I think it would be much better for the EU and the UK to have an orderly Brexit,"" Faury told a conference. ""This being said, if there is no deal we will have to live with it. There will be a more difficult transition on Dec. 31 and we are preparing ourselves for some logistical issues, but we don't think this is going to be unmanageable,"" he added. His comments came after Britain’s manufacturing industry warned of a potential ""knockout blow"" if Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unable to secure a trade deal with the EU before temporary arrangements end on Dec. 31. Faury also called for compromise in a dispute over aircraft subsidies in which the EU and United States have both imposed tariffs on multiple goods. ""We are calling for a de-escalation ... and finding a long-term agreement between the U.S. and the EU, and we think this is what will happen,"" Faury told the Conference of Montreal. ""And it will happen under the Biden administration, but I think it would have happened anyway,"" he added. Diplomats say the EU and outgoing Trump administration are in ""serious"" negotiations to end the 16-year-old trade fight, which has come to a head just as Britain leaves the EU. Airbus found itself squeezed between the two sets of trade negotiations last week when Britain halted tariffs on U.S. goods adopted in support of Airbus as it completes its EU exit.","Dec 14, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-urges-compromises-brexit-transatlantic-tariffs-2020-12-14/

Tebboune, 75, appeared in a video posted on Twitter and  broadcast on state television. He said he is expected to make a complete recovery within three weeks at the latest. ""I'm recovering...I will recover my physical capacities in a week, two weeks or three weeks,"" he said. ""We will soon be in the country to continue building a new Algeria.""  Elected in December last year to succeed Abdelaziz Bouteflika who resigned after mass protests, Tebboune has promised to carry out political and economic reforms in the North African country, an OPEC member. Early last month, Algerians approved changes to the constitution aimed at giving more powers to the parliament and prime minister as well as boosting political freedoms, although voter turnout was very low. Tebboune said he had asked his staff at the presidency to coordinate with the election authority to prepare for a new election law, adding this law would pave the way for the post-constitution period. ""I have been following what is taking place in Algeria on a daily basis,"" he said. Since taking office Tebboune has announced plans to reform the economy and diversify it away from oil and gas, seeking to ease financial pressure caused by a fall in energy revenue - which accounts for 60% of the state budget and 94% of total export revenue.

2020-12-13,Reuters,"Suspected Russian hackers spied on U.S. Treasury emails - sources Hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, according to people familiar with the matter, adding they feared the hacks uncovered so far may be the tip of the iceberg. The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter.      U.S. officials have not said much publicly beyond the Commerce Department confirming there was a breach at one of its agencies and that they asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot added that they ""are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation."" The U.S. government has not publicly identified who might be behind the hacking, but three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be responsible for the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye (FEYE.O), a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. In a statement posted to Facebook, the Russian foreign ministry described the allegations as another unfounded attempt by the U.S. media to blame Russia for cyberattacks against U.S. agencies.  The cyber spies are believed to have gotten in by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by IT company SolarWinds (SWI.N), which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a ""supply chain attack"" - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties. In a statement released late Sunday, the Austin, Texas-based company said that updates to its monitoring software released between March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a ""highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.""  The company declined to offer any further detail, but the diversity of SolarWind's customer base has sparked concern within the U.S. intelligence community that other government agencies may be at risk, according to four people briefed on the matter.  SolarWinds says on its website that its customers include most of America's Fortune 500 companies, the top 10 U.S. telecommunications providers, all five branches of the U.S. military, the State Department, the National Security Agency, and the Office of President of the United States.","Dec 13, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/suspected-russian-hackers-spied-us-treasury-emails-sources-2020-12-13/

2020-12-13,Reuters,"Trump revives threat to veto defense bill, teeing up battle with lawmakers U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated his threat to veto a massive defense policy bill, setting the stage for a major battle with U.S. lawmakers at a time when they are racing to hammer out a compromise on more coronavirus relief. The $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed both houses of Congress with more than the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto.  Passage by the Republican-controlled Senate on Friday sent the measure to Trump, giving him 10 days - minus Sundays - to veto it, sign it or allow it become law without his signature. Trump shrugged off hopes by backers of the bill that strong bipartisan support for the measure - which has become law for 59 straight years - would prompt him to reconsider his threat. ""THE BIGGEST WINNER OF OUR NEW DEFENSE BILL IS CHINA! I WILL VETO!"" Trump tweeted on Sunday as he headed to the golf course he owns outside Washington. The White House had no immediate comment about when Trump would act or what he meant by the reference to China. Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the bill contained bipartisan provisions that were ""tougher on China than the Trump administration has ever been.""     Trump previously objected to the fiscal 2021 NDAA because it did not repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) from liability for what appears on their platforms. Trump has argued that tech firms have an anti-conservative bias, which the companies deny. Lawmakers from both parties say that concerns about social media should not kill legislation considered essential for the Pentagon. A source familiar with Trump's thinking said the president was concerned that Twitter and other platforms often flagged comments by conservatives while allowing posts from Chinese officials that the Trump administration considers problematic.","Dec 13, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-revives-threat-veto-defense-bill-teeing-up-battle-with-lawmakers-2020-12-13/

2020-12-13,Reuters,"Dutch weigh stricter lockdown as COVID-19 cases jump The Dutch government is set to decide on stricter measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak in the Netherlands on Monday, as the infection rate has climbed back to the peak levels reached at the end of October. New coronavirus infections in the country jumped by almost 10,000 in the 24 hours through Sunday morning, data released by national health authorities showed, the biggest rise in more than six weeks. The increase continues a rising trend seen over the previous week, as the effects of a partial lockdown that has been in effect since Oct. 13 seem to have waned. All bars and restaurants in the country have been closed since mid-October, and people were urged to work from home as much as possible, but schools and shops have remained open.  This, however, looks likely to change after an emergency cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday, Dutch media said. Citing government sources, public broadcaster NOS said the government was considering closing all non-essential shops for several weeks and extending the Christmas break for schools among measures to stop the spread of the disease.

2020-12-12,Reuters,"Leaders to push Brexit trade talks beyond Sunday deadline London and Brussels agreed on Sunday to ""go the extra mile"" in coming days to try to reach an elusive trade agreement despite missing their latest deadline to avert a turbulent exit for Britain from the European Union's orbit at the end of the month. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the president of the EU's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen had given negotiators a Sunday deadline to find a way to resolve an impasse on arrangements that would guarantee Britain zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the EU's single market. On Sunday they mandated negotiators to continue, although Johnson sounded a downbeat note on prospects for a breakthrough. ""Despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations, despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile,"" Johnson and von der Leyen said in a joint statement. Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union. Johnson said the two sides would try to be as creative as possible but Britain could not compromise on key ""red lines"" so the most likely option was no deal, with trade reverting to the non-concessionary terms set by the World Trade Organization.     A final Brexit without a trade deal would damage the economies of Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains across Europe and beyond. ""Every opportunity to reach a deal is highly welcome,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin. The two sides have struggled to agree on fishing rights in British waters and EU demands that Britain face consequences if in the future it diverges from the bloc's rules for fair competition - what it calls a level playing field. Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that despite recent comments from the British side, he understood that there was largely agreement on maintaining existing standards.","Dec 12, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/leaders-push-brexit-trade-talks-beyond-sunday-deadline-2020-12-13/

""Today, I wish to announce some further commitments for 2030,"" told Xi a one-day virtual U.N. summit on climate change  via video before announcing the targets.  ""China always honours its commitments."" China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter, will cut its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product, or carbon intensity, by more than 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, said Xi.     That compares to targets China announced in 2015 of lowering carbon intensity by 60-65% by 2030.     Xi also said that China will boost its installed capacity of wind and solar power to more than 1,200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25% during the same period, up from a previous commitment of 20%. As of 2019, China had combined accumulative installed solar and wind capacity of around 414 GW. China's state planner is aiming to have 240 GW of wind and the same amount of solar capacity installed by the end of this year.   ""(China's new target) demonstrates good will,"" said Li Shuo, a climate advisor with environmental group Greenpeace. Li estimated that China's new carbon intensity target would mean China would reach the peak of its carbon emissions between 2025 and 2030.  ""However, Beijing has the potential to do more. Making its emissions peak earlier than 2025 is still something it should strive for,"" said Li, adding that Greenpeace was expecting China to cut its carbon intensity by 70-75% by 2030.","Dec 12, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-targets-steeper-cut-carbon-intensity-by-2030-2020-12-12/

2020-12-12,Reuters,"INSIGHT Malaysia's Top Glove fired whistleblower before virus outbreak Yubaraj Khadka, a worker in Malaysia for Top Glove Corp (TPGC.KL), took two photos in May of fellow employees crowding into a factory of the world’s biggest maker of medical-grade latex gloves.  As the coronavirus pandemic raged, the photos seen by Reuters show dozens of workers lined up less than a metre apart to have their temperatures checked before starting the night shift as a precaution against the disease.  The company required everyone to wear masks and gloves, but Khadka and five other workers told Reuters that social distancing was not enforced or followed outside the factory.  Afraid of losing his job if he complained directly to management, Khadka, 27, sent the photos to a workers’ rights campaigner in his native Nepal who sent them on to the company and the Malaysian government, without identifying who took them.  On Sept. 23, Top Glove sent Khadka a letter terminating his employment for sharing the photos. In the letter, seen by Reuters, the company said it identified him as the originator of the photos from CCTV coverage of workers entering the factory.   Fast-forward almost three months, Top Glove’s complex of factories and dormitories in Klang, 40 km (25 miles) west of Kuala Lumpur, has become Malaysia’s biggest coronavirus cluster with more than 5,000 infections, about 94% of them foreigners, the country’s health ministry said in a statement on Dec. 1. On Monday, Top Glove reported its first death from the virus, a 29-year-old worker from Nepal. On Wednesday the company had said a total of 5,147 workers in its Klang factories had tested positive.  The episode is another indicator of how the risk of infection by the virus has fallen most heavily on poorer, manual workers in crowded facilities across the world, from meat-packing plants to shipping warehouses. On Nov. 23, Malaysia’s government ordered Top Glove to begin shutting its factories in stages, so workers could be tested. The country’s Labour Department said earlier this month it would file charges against Top Glove over its worker accommodation, which it found to be cramped and poorly ventilated. ""There was no one-metre distancing. That's what I wanted to show,"" Khadka told Reuters from Nepal, where he is looking for work.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"U.S. Supreme Court takes up Goldman securities class action appeal The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) appeal in a securities fraud case that could redefine the ability of shareholders to pursue class actions against public companies whose stock prices fall. Goldman is appealing an April decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan allowing a class action accusing the bank of hiding conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis. A decision is likely before the end of the court's current term in June. The case stemmed from Goldman's sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson. In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve charges it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson's role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting the CDO would fail. Shareholders led by three pension plans claimed that before the news came out, the bank had misled them and inflated its stock price with such statements that client interests ""always come first"" and that ""integrity and honesty"" mattered. The 2nd Circuit presumed that shareholders relied on such statements when buying Goldman stock, and rejected the bank's argument that allowing lawsuits based on seemingly generic statements would unleash a flood of litigation. Goldman described its appeal as ""the most important securities case"" before the Supreme Court in several years, and drew support for it from business and financial industry groups. The bank also won support from the Society for Corporate Governance, which said a Goldman loss could prompt companies to clam up on social issues such as diversity and racial justice, ""out of fear that even generalized or aspirational statements"" could prompt securities fraud claims.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"GRAPHIC Take Five: Brexit brinkmanship; Fed watching and China bashing 1/BREXIT AND BOE   When the Bank of England announced a 150 billion pound increase in stimulus last month, it probably didn't anticipate acting again soon.  If a Brexit trade deal had been signed by now, as expected, that would have been sufficient to shield the economy. But it hasn't quite gone that way. Another Brexit deadline looms on Sunday and banks are quietly raising the odds of no-deal.    No agreement by Thursday's meeting would mean the BOE will need to focus on increased risks to the economy and possibly open the doors for more stimulus and sub-zero interest rates.  Until recently, the 0.10% Bank rate was not expected to change until 2022. But Brexit deadlock means money markets now price a 65% probability of a 10 basis point (bps) cut by March 2021, doubling from a month ago. -Bank of England ramps up stimulus again to tackle COVID-19 and Brexit hit -Chances of Brexit trade deal narrow for banks and bookmakers  2/LONG GAME AT FED November's U.S. inflation uptick has increased speculation the Federal Reserve will on Wednesday announce plans to up purchases of longer-dated Treasuries to keep yields contained. Ten- and 30-year U.S. borrowing costs are up by roughly 60 and 100 bps respectively from record lows hit in March. Two-year yields are just 4 bps off record lows. That's unsurprising -- the majority of the Fed's $2 trillion purchases since March have been of short-dated debt.","Dec 11, 2020",https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-markets-themes-takealook-2020-12-11/

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) had not provided any details on Wednesday, when it disclosed the cyber attack, but Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) had said documents related to the development of their COVID-19 vaccine had been ""unlawfully accessed"".  The EMA said on Friday ""concerned companies"" were being informed, without naming them, and that the breach had not affected its operations, or timelines, related to the evaluation and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"U.S. gaming platform Roblox to delay IPO until next year U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp has put off its planned initial public offering (IPO) until next year as it works with advisers to improve the process to benefit employees and investors, the company told employees in a memo seen by Reuters. ""We've seen companies take innovative approaches to creating a more market-based relationship between investors and companies,"" Roblox Chief Executive David Baszucki said in the memo, dated Friday. ""We've decided to take this opportunity to work with our advisers to see how we can make such improvements."" Baszucki said the company expects to list early next year. The San Mateo, California-based firm had filed to raise $1 billion through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange and was expected to join a year-end IPO wave. A person familiar with the company said it hoped to get a higher IPO pricing after seeing Airbnb Inc (ABNB.O) and DoorDash Inc (DASH.N) spike on their first day trading this week, which it sees as examples of companies underpricing IPO shares and leaving money on the table. The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Affirm Holdings Inc(AFRM.O) is also postponing its IPO.  The lending startup, which had been set to begin marketing its shares to investors this coming week for a December listing, will not go public until January at the earliest, the Journal reported, citing sources. Affirm declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. DoorDash raised $3.4 billion and its stock rose as much as 92% on the first day of trading, while Airbnb jumped as much as 142% in its $3.5 billion IPO.  Earlier this year, Roblox had floated the idea of a direct listing - in which existing investors sell their shares and investment banks play less of a role - but in the end chose the IPO route, sources said.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"Exxon Mobil to cut 700 jobs in Houston -government notice Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will lay off more than 700 workers in the Houston area, according to a notice it sent to the Texas Workforce Commission posted on Friday. The largest U.S. oil producer had previously said it would cut its global workforce by about 15%, or around 14,000 jobs, including deep cuts in the United States. Exxon and other oil companies have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic and ill-timed bets on new projects. The layoff date is Feb. 2, according to the notice. The 700 jobs are part of around 1,900 U.S. cuts anticipated, which the company has said would come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses. Exxon last month said it would write down the value of natural gas properties by $17 billion to $20 billion, its biggest ever impairment, and slash project spending next year to its lowest level in 15 years. It had about 88,300 workers, including 13,300 contractors, at the end of last year.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"Indiana hospital rehearses roll-out of much-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine Anticipating the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic, doctors, nurses and pharmacists at an Indianapolis hospital staged a dress rehearsal on Friday of procedures for administering the first COVID-19 vaccine expected to be approved by U.S. regulators.  In a makeshift clinic on the campus of Indiana University Health, about a dozen clinicians went through a dry run of each step in the process of getting the serum, developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE), into the arms of patients.     ""We are fine-tuning all the processes to make sure when vaccine shows up and that first patient arrives that this will go as seamless as possible,"" said Mary Kay Foster, the manager of the special pathogens unit at IU Health, as a small group nearby worked out kinks in the patient registration process.    The hospital is one of the first healthcare facilities in the United States designated to administer the Pfizer vaccine, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve for emergency use as early as Friday evening.  Distribution and inoculations are expected to begin almost immediately thereafter, marking a major stride in the race to stop a pandemic that has already killed 290,000 Americans. IU Health officials said they expected 975 doses of the vaccine in the initial shipment. ""I can't wait to tell everyone that we are making history,"" said Lindsey Richardt, a communications official at the Indiana hospital, who acted as a patient. ""Today was just day one so we are just getting the hang of things.""      As part of the drill, the team huddled around laptops and some of the clinic's 11 vaccination stations, poring over details of the procedure. Some of the medical staff acted the part of vaccine recipients while others learned the registration and administration processes. Members of the hospital's pharmacy fine-tuned the delicate process of moving the vaccine from cold storage and preparing it for injection. ""This is such a prized commodity,"" said Tate Trujillo, pharmacy director at IU Health, as he stood next to two freezers that will keep the vaccine at -80 Celsius. ""We want shots in people's arms and we don't want to miss a dose.""     The mood of anticipation and hope during the dry run was tempered by the knowledge that Indiana has experienced a massive surge in infections, hospitalizations and deaths in recent weeks. Per capita, the state had the second-worst COVID-19 spread in the United States this week, behind Rhode Island, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last spring, IU Health admitted more than 100 COVID-19 patients a day for two straight months. That number dropped to 20 over the summer before spiking to more than 150 this week, according to hospital officials.

2020-12-11,Reuters,"U.S. Congress bans anonymous shell companies The U.S Senate on Friday passed a bill overhauling anti-money laundering rules and banning anonymous shell companies, a victory for law enforcement and rights groups which have long sought changes to make it easier to police illicit money flows. The bill requires most companies to report their true beneficial owners to the government, allows greater information sharing between law enforcement and regulators, and authorizes the use of new suspicious activity monitoring tools. Cracking down on legal vehicles that allow criminals and terrorists to move money around the world has become a pressing issue for policymakers as a slew of scandals in recent years has revealed the true extent of illicit global money flows. The United States' weak rules on disclosing corporate owners have allowed criminals to use legal entities to shuffle their cash around the world, according to the authorities. In 2011, the World Bank found that the United States each year produced nearly 10 times as many legal entities with anonymous owners as 41 tax havens combined. ""The global law enforcement and national security community will reap enormous benefits from anti-money laundering policy that stops bad actors from using shell companies to shepherd crime across international borders,"" said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, which lobbied for the changes. Friday's bill, included as part of a broader defense funding package, was approved by the U.S. Senate after the House of Representatives passed it earlier this week. The bill now heads to President Donald Trump. While Trump had suggested he could veto the bill over separate policy disputes, the Senate vote of 84 to 13 provides more than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.  If signed into law, the bill should help banks by allowing them to share the burden of identifying and tracking potential illegal activity.
