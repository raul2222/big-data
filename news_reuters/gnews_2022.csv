2022-04-21,Reuters,"Kremlin asks why Zelenskiy is not seeing its proposal The Kremlin said on Thursday that Moscow was still waiting for Ukraine's response to Russia's latest written proposal in peace talks between the two sides, and questioned why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was unaware of the document. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he had not seen or heard about the text the Kremlin said it had sent.  ""I repeat once again, as I said yesterday, our formulations, in fact the latest version, were handed to our opponents, to the Ukrainian negotiating delegation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of Zelenskiy's comment, ""which also raises certain questions about why no one is reporting to President Zelenskiy about our versions of the text"". The comments from the two sides appeared to highlight both the gulf in their positions and the poor state of communication between them, eight weeks after Russia sent its troops and tanks into Ukraine and more than three weeks after they last held face-to-face talks on March 29. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on April 12 that the talks had come to a dead end. Ukraine's chief negotiator said on Tuesday it was hard to predict when they might resume because of Russia's siege of Mariupol and what he said was Moscow's desire to strengthen its position through a new military offensive. Russia says it was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, and protect Russian-speakers there from ""genocide"" - arguments denounced by Kyiv and the West as baseless pretexts for war. Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the loss of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and of the eastern Donbas region which is now the focus of the Russian offensive. Ukraine says it will not compromise on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. (This story corrects typo in Zelenskiy's first name in first paragraph.)

""The coast guard has been ordered by the anti-money laundering authority to release the vessel,"" a Greek government official said, without providing further details. On Tuesday, Greek authorities impounded the 115,500-deadweight tonnage Russian-flagged Pegas, with 19 Russian crew members on board, on the southern coast of the island of Evia. They said the ship was impounded as part of EU sanctions on Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, the EU banned Russian-flagged vessels from its ports, with some exemptions, as it adopted new sanctions against Russia for what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"". The Pegas tanker was also among five vessels sanctioned by the United States on Feb. 22, 2022 - two days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine - as part of broader sanctions against Promsvyazbank, a bank Washington described as critical to Russia's defence sector. https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0602 Promsvyazbank said it and its unit PSB Lizing were not the owners of the tanker as it was bought back by its owner in April 2021.

Drawn by rumours on social media, young men and old, many with their military records in hand, arrived with hopes of fighting for Russia in Ukraine. What began as a trickle of volunteers swelled over two weeks to scores, two neighbourhood residents told Reuters. On Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw several hundred men registering with Ethiopian security guards outside the embassy. The guards recorded their names and asked for proof of military service. There is no evidence that any Ethiopians have been sent to Ukraine, nor is it clear if any ever will be. A man who came out of the embassy and addressed the volunteers in Russian through an interpreter said Russia had enough forces for now, but that they would be contacted when they were needed. The Russian embassy did not respond to questions from Reuters about the man's identity or whether Russia was deploying Ethiopian volunteers to Ukraine. It issued a statement later on Tuesday saying that it was not recruiting fighters, and that the Ethiopians who showed up outside were well-wishers expressing ""solidarity and support for the Russian Federation"". The Ethiopian foreign ministry welcomed the Russian statement for what it called ""refuting the unfounded reports of recruitment for the Russian Armed Forces"" but did not respond to Reuters questions. Neither did the Russian foreign ministry. Ukraine's embassy in Addis Ababa referred questions to the Ethiopian authorities. Ethiopia has called on all sides in the war to exercise restraint and did not vote on a UN General Assembly resolution condemning the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine which Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise the country.

During a video speech to the annual Boao Asia Forum, Xi said that the world should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, while paying attention to the ""legitimate"" security concerns of all. ""We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security on the basis of insecurity in other countries,"" Xi told the gathering on the southern Chinese island of Hainan. In talks over Ukraine, Russia has insisted that Western governments respect a 1999 agreement based on the principle of ""indivisible security"" that no country can strengthen its own security at the expense of others.  China and Russia have grown increasingly close, and China has refused to condemn Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise the country. China has blamed the Ukraine crisis on NATO's eastward expansion. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, responding to a question about Xi's speech at a regular briefing in Washington, said China continued to ""parrot some of what we have heard coming from the Kremlin"", including the concept of ""indivisible security."" Price reiterated that China would face serious consequences if it gave material support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine, but that Washington had not yet seen Beijing provide that kind of assistance to Moscow. The United States would continue to uphold the rules-based international system it had built with like-minded partners based on respect for human rights, sovereignty, and self-determination, Price said. ""We are committed to upholding the various systems that certain countries around the world – and Russia and the PRC are among them - seek to challenge, and in certain instances, seek to tear down and even destroy,"" he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.

Malpass told a World Bank conference on Ukraine's financial assistance needs that the early estimate of ""narrow"" damage costs does not include the growing economic costs of the war to Ukraine. ""Of course the war is still ongoing, so those costs are rising,"" Malpass said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a virtual address to the conference, outlined far bigger costs and financing needs. He told participants in interpreted remarks that Ukraine needs $7 billion per month to make up for economic losses caused by Russia's invasion of his country. ""And we will need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild all this later,"" Zelenskiy said. He said the global community needed to exclude Russia immediately from international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and others, and said all countries ""must immediately be prepared to break up all relations with Russia."" The conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings included finance officials from a number of countries, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who earlier said the United States would double its direct non-military aid pledge to $1 billion.  Zelenskiy said called for countries that have imposed sanctions and freezes on Russian assets to use that money to help rebuild Ukraine after the war and to pay for losses suffered by other countries.

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for China this year to 4.4%, well below Beijing's target of around 5.5%, on the risks of widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions.  In a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia, Georgieva said China's actions to counter its economic slowdown are vital for the global recovery. ""Fortunately, China has policy space to provide macroeconomic policy support, including shifting the focus toward vulnerable households to strengthen consumption, which can also help support China's climate goals by steering economic activity to lower-carbon sectors,"" Georgieva added. ""Stronger policy efforts in the property sector can also help secure a balanced recovery."" At the same venue, China's President Xi Jinping said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed. In light of growing headwinds, foreign brokerages have also been slashing GDP forecasts for China, after weakness in March activity data raised outlook risks as the lockdown in the mega city of Shanghai drags on.

A currency crisis late last year sent inflation soaring and prompted the government to raise prices of everything from gas and electricity to road tolls, alcohol, bus fares and petrol in January.  ""This is not a call for civil disobedience, this is resistance. This is a fight for your rights. My fight is to be the voice of the families and children that are left in the dark,"" Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu said as he sat beside his wife in his house in Ankara lit by a gas lantern. ""We will be in the dark for a week with my wife ... I will sit in the darkness to experience the pain of my people,"" he also said. Annual inflation rose further to 61% in March. Many analysts blame the economic turmoil on a series of unorthodox interest rate cuts engineered by President Tayyip Erdogan last year. Kilicdaroglu said in February he would stop paying his electricity bills and called for the price hikes to be rolled back. He said earlier on Thursday electricity prices - which went up between 50% and 125% at the beginning of 2022 - had risen more than 400% in three years. Nearly 4 million Turkish subscribers had their power cut in 2021, Kilicdaroglu added without giving a source for that information. The inflationary surge has hit Erdogan's popularity ahead of national elections due no later than June 2023, in which Kilicdaroglu is seen as a potential contender for the presidency.  Years of double-digit inflation in addition to the recent jump have eroded household savings and earnings.

The United States and its allies have ramped up arms shipments to Kyiv ahead of Russia's announced offensive in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow tries to salvage its nearly two-month old campaign. Ukrainian forces have used Western weapons including Stinger and Javelin missiles along with drones, like the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and U.S.-made Switchblade, effectively to target Russian positions. The White House said earlier on Thursday that over 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems would be provided to Ukraine as part of the new arms package.  The Pentagon said the Ghost drones are well suited for the coming fight in Ukraine's Donbas region, which officials have described as flat terrain reminiscent of the U.S. state of Kansas. ""It was developed for a set of requirements that very closely match what the Ukrainians need right now in Donbas,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said, without elaborating. Little else is known about the drones, including their range and precise capabilities, and Kirby declined to offer more details about them. Still, he did say they were designed mainly for striking targets. ""It can also be used to give you a sight picture of what it's seeing, of course. But its principal focus is attack,"" Kirby said.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Special Report: Sanctioned weapons mogul who supplied Russia’s troops has ties to Philip Morris A longtime Russian business associate of American tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc Igor Kesaev, 55, listed by Forbes as Russia’s 35th-richest person last year, was sanctioned April 13 by the United Kingdom and on April 8 by the European Union. The EU noted in its sanctions document that Kesaev’s holdings in tobacco distribution and weapons production are funneling “substantial” revenue to the Russian Federation to fund its “destabilisation of Ukraine.” Kesaev owned a 49% share in the V.A. Degtyarev plant, located 165 miles northeast of Moscow, which makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military and countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, according to Russian business records as of Dec. 31 and the plant’s website. The plant is known for producing Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles. Kesaev’s interest in the weapons business dates back to at least 2012, Degtyarev’s corporate filings show. Kesaev spokesperson Anatoly Shiryaev told Reuters in an emailed statement Wednesday that Kesaev “currently is not a shareholder” in Degtyarev and “isn’t part of its management.” Shiryaev didn’t respond to follow-up questions or requests to provide documentation of Kesaev’s exit from the arms business. The Degtyarev plant’s 2021 annual report - released April 14 - listed Kesaev as holding a 49% stake in the factory. Alexander Tmenov, the plant’s general director, referred to Kesaev as “our main shareholder” in an in-house publication dated March 16 and posted on the Degtyarev facility’s website. In its April 8 sanctions document, the EU referred to Kesaev as “the major shareholder of Degtyarev Plant.” Until recently, Kesaev was also the board chairman of a sprawling Russian tobacco distribution company, TC Megapolis JSC. And he was a board member of that firm's Dutch holding company, in which Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has a 23% stake. Kesaev resigned both posts April 11, according to Philip Morris and a TC Megapolis JSC press release. He retains ultimate control of Megapolis, however, according to the EU. In its sanctions statement, the EU said Kesaev is the president and owner of Mercury Group, which owns Megapolis, “the leading tobacco distributor in Russia.” In his emailed statement, Kesaev spokesperson Shiryaev said the businessman “isn’t part of the Megapolis Group’s management and therefore doesn’t comment on Megapolis' relations with (Philip Morris).” Reuters couldn’t determine the size of Kesaev’s stake in the holding company, Megapolis Distribution BV. A December report from Russia-focused business news service Interfax said Kesaev and a longtime business associate, Sergei Katsiev, together owned 52.8%. The April 11 Megapolis press release said Kesaev is not a controlling or majority shareholder in the distribution company or any of its subsidiaries, and that he doesn’t influence or make decisions about the business. Philip Morris’ ties with Kesaev date to the early 1990s, when the entrepreneur helped the American firm navigate post-Soviet Russia and tap its coveted market of heavy smokers, according to news reports. That relationship could now prove a public-relations nightmare for the company.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"How Australia could help Europe solve its green energy gap April 19 - With the war in Ukraine forcing the European Union to cut its dependence on fossil fuels from Russia, one renewable technology that has come into sharper focus is green hydrogen. Hydrogen produced using renewable energy such as wind and solar instead of natural gas, is viewed as key to decarbonising sectors such as steel, shipping and chemicals. In March, as part of its RePowerEU plan to replace Russian fossil fuel imports, the Commission said it wants to quadruple the existing target in its “Fit for 55” climate plan from 5 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes by 2030. While 10 million tonnes will be sourced locally, a further 10 million will need to be imported, and the Commission announced a “hydrogen accelerator” programme to spur the development of the necessary infrastructure, storage and port facilities. Several countries have already announced plans to become production and export hubs for green hydrogen, including Oman and Chile. But some of the loudest noise is coming from Australia, where there is a string of initiatives to develop gigawatt-scale solar and wind power projects to produce green hydrogen. Just one company, Perth-headquartered Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), aims to be producing 15 million tonnes a year by 2030, and another 50 million a year in the 2030s. It will be used to decarbonise the operations of its parent group, Fortescue Metals, while the rest will be exported. Last year, UK construction company JCB and Ryze Hydrogen committed to take 10% of FFI's green hydrogen production, while in January, ahead of the Russian invasion, FFI announced a deal to supply Germany chemical company Covestro the equivalent of 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 2024 onwards. Last month March FFI, and Germany’s largest energy group, E.ON, announced they were exploring how 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen could be shipped from Australia to Germany. Interviewed before the launch of REPowerEU, Julie Shuttleworth, FFI’s chief executive, said her company is securing projects across the world. “Demand is now much stronger than it was, so we’re very confident that we'll be able to sell it all. In fact, we don't think the world is going to be able to make enough for what we actually need by 2030,” said Shuttleworth. One of the big challenges is the vast amount of renewable energy required to power electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen.

The United States disputed Putin's claim and said it believed Ukrainian forces still held ground in the city. Putin ordered his troops to blockade the steel complex, where Ukrainians were told earlier to either surrender or die. Ukraine said Putin wanted to avoid a final clash with its forces in Mariupol, as he lacked troops to defeat them. But Ukrainian officials also appealed for help to evacuate civilians and wounded soldiers. In a televised meeting at the Kremlin, Putin congratulated his defence minister and Russian troops for having ""successfully completed the combat effort to liberate Mariupol"". He said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the Azovstal steel plant. ""There's no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities... Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can get through,"" Putin said. Mariupol, a major port in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, sits between areas held by Russian separatists and Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow seized in 2014. Capturing the city would allow Russia to link the two areas as it intensifies its offensive in Ukraine's east.  Even as Putin claims his first big prize since his forces were driven away from the capital Kyiv and northern Ukraine last month, it falls short of the unambiguous victory Moscow has sought after months of combat in a city reduced to rubble.

However, there are still 18 projects with a capacity of 19.2 GW that are in a ""gray area"" and could still go ahead, having secured the necessary financing and permits, the Helsinki-based think tank, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said on Friday. President Xi Jinping announced to the United Nations General Assembly in September that China, the world's biggest energy consumer, would end overseas coal projects as part of its contribution to the global effort to cut climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The move was estimated to involve more than $50 billion in investments, but it was unclear at the time whether existing construction plans would go ahead.  However, new guidelines published last month by China's state planning agency have added clarity, and could also encourage the reexamination of another 30 China-backed plants now under construction overseas, involving a total capacity of 30 GW, CREA said. ""Projects under construction... are recommended to proceed 'steadily' and with 'caution',"" CREA said. ""This leaves options open for Chinese firms to withdraw if they have sufficient reason and manageable penalties to do so, particularly if projects are in earlier stages of construction."" The new guidelines indicate that more than a third of all new coal power projects outside of China and India will now be scrapped. “China's new directive is the first of its kind - a large emitter with a major global carbon footprint committing to enable low-carbon transitions overseas,"" said Kevin P.

The warm words from North Korea to President Moon Jae-in came in an exchange of letters less than three weeks before Moon leaves office to be replaced by a conservative leader who has already signalled a tougher line on North Korea Analysts were sceptical that North Korea's message heralded a broader improvement in relations, and warned that the praise for Moon could be a bid to portray his successor, Yoon Suk-yeol, as responsible for any further deterioration in ties.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Biden to unveil new U.S. drug addiction and overdose strategy U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil a new strategy for dealing with drug addiction and overdoses on Thursday that aims to expand access to medications for opioid overdoses, increase funding for law enforcement, and expand sanctions against traffickers. The Biden administration is keen to show it is taking action on a worsening U.S. opioid crisis, which fueled more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. ""That's an American life lost every five minutes around the clock,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. ""For too many years, the overdose crisis has been unraveling the very social fabric of our nation and destroying American lives and livelihoods,"" Gupta told reporters on a press call. The National Drug Control Strategy, which Biden will send to Congress on Thursday, seeks to double treatment admissions for populations that are most at risk of overdose deaths and ensure universal access to medications for opioid use disorder by 2025. Currently, key tools like naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, and syringe service programs are often restricted or underfunded. There are legal barriers limiting access to naloxone in some states, and even in others the drug is not always available to those most at risk of an overdose. Patients are more likely to receive a naloxone prescription if they had a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence along with an overdose compared with individuals who had those diagnoses without an overdose.
