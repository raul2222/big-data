2022-04-21,Reuters,"Kremlin asks why Zelenskiy is not seeing its proposal The Kremlin said on Thursday that Moscow was still waiting for Ukraine's response to Russia's latest written proposal in peace talks between the two sides, and questioned why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was unaware of the document. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he had not seen or heard about the text the Kremlin said it had sent.  ""I repeat once again, as I said yesterday, our formulations, in fact the latest version, were handed to our opponents, to the Ukrainian negotiating delegation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of Zelenskiy's comment, ""which also raises certain questions about why no one is reporting to President Zelenskiy about our versions of the text"". The comments from the two sides appeared to highlight both the gulf in their positions and the poor state of communication between them, eight weeks after Russia sent its troops and tanks into Ukraine and more than three weeks after they last held face-to-face talks on March 29. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on April 12 that the talks had come to a dead end. Ukraine's chief negotiator said on Tuesday it was hard to predict when they might resume because of Russia's siege of Mariupol and what he said was Moscow's desire to strengthen its position through a new military offensive. Russia says it was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, and protect Russian-speakers there from ""genocide"" - arguments denounced by Kyiv and the West as baseless pretexts for war. Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the loss of Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and of the eastern Donbas region which is now the focus of the Russian offensive. Ukraine says it will not compromise on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. (This story corrects typo in Zelenskiy's first name in first paragraph.)

""The coast guard has been ordered by the anti-money laundering authority to release the vessel,"" a Greek government official said, without providing further details. On Tuesday, Greek authorities impounded the 115,500-deadweight tonnage Russian-flagged Pegas, with 19 Russian crew members on board, on the southern coast of the island of Evia. They said the ship was impounded as part of EU sanctions on Russia for the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, the EU banned Russian-flagged vessels from its ports, with some exemptions, as it adopted new sanctions against Russia for what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"". The Pegas tanker was also among five vessels sanctioned by the United States on Feb. 22, 2022 - two days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine - as part of broader sanctions against Promsvyazbank, a bank Washington described as critical to Russia's defence sector. https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0602 Promsvyazbank said it and its unit PSB Lizing were not the owners of the tanker as it was bought back by its owner in April 2021.

Drawn by rumours on social media, young men and old, many with their military records in hand, arrived with hopes of fighting for Russia in Ukraine. What began as a trickle of volunteers swelled over two weeks to scores, two neighbourhood residents told Reuters. On Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw several hundred men registering with Ethiopian security guards outside the embassy. The guards recorded their names and asked for proof of military service. There is no evidence that any Ethiopians have been sent to Ukraine, nor is it clear if any ever will be. A man who came out of the embassy and addressed the volunteers in Russian through an interpreter said Russia had enough forces for now, but that they would be contacted when they were needed. The Russian embassy did not respond to questions from Reuters about the man's identity or whether Russia was deploying Ethiopian volunteers to Ukraine. It issued a statement later on Tuesday saying that it was not recruiting fighters, and that the Ethiopians who showed up outside were well-wishers expressing ""solidarity and support for the Russian Federation"". The Ethiopian foreign ministry welcomed the Russian statement for what it called ""refuting the unfounded reports of recruitment for the Russian Armed Forces"" but did not respond to Reuters questions. Neither did the Russian foreign ministry. Ukraine's embassy in Addis Ababa referred questions to the Ethiopian authorities. Ethiopia has called on all sides in the war to exercise restraint and did not vote on a UN General Assembly resolution condemning the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine which Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise the country.

During a video speech to the annual Boao Asia Forum, Xi said that the world should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, while paying attention to the ""legitimate"" security concerns of all. ""We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security on the basis of insecurity in other countries,"" Xi told the gathering on the southern Chinese island of Hainan. In talks over Ukraine, Russia has insisted that Western governments respect a 1999 agreement based on the principle of ""indivisible security"" that no country can strengthen its own security at the expense of others.  China and Russia have grown increasingly close, and China has refused to condemn Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise the country. China has blamed the Ukraine crisis on NATO's eastward expansion. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, responding to a question about Xi's speech at a regular briefing in Washington, said China continued to ""parrot some of what we have heard coming from the Kremlin"", including the concept of ""indivisible security."" Price reiterated that China would face serious consequences if it gave material support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine, but that Washington had not yet seen Beijing provide that kind of assistance to Moscow. The United States would continue to uphold the rules-based international system it had built with like-minded partners based on respect for human rights, sovereignty, and self-determination, Price said. ""We are committed to upholding the various systems that certain countries around the world – and Russia and the PRC are among them - seek to challenge, and in certain instances, seek to tear down and even destroy,"" he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.

Malpass told a World Bank conference on Ukraine's financial assistance needs that the early estimate of ""narrow"" damage costs does not include the growing economic costs of the war to Ukraine. ""Of course the war is still ongoing, so those costs are rising,"" Malpass said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a virtual address to the conference, outlined far bigger costs and financing needs. He told participants in interpreted remarks that Ukraine needs $7 billion per month to make up for economic losses caused by Russia's invasion of his country. ""And we will need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild all this later,"" Zelenskiy said. He said the global community needed to exclude Russia immediately from international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and others, and said all countries ""must immediately be prepared to break up all relations with Russia."" The conference on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings included finance officials from a number of countries, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who earlier said the United States would double its direct non-military aid pledge to $1 billion.  Zelenskiy said called for countries that have imposed sanctions and freezes on Russian assets to use that money to help rebuild Ukraine after the war and to pay for losses suffered by other countries.

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for China this year to 4.4%, well below Beijing's target of around 5.5%, on the risks of widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions.  In a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia, Georgieva said China's actions to counter its economic slowdown are vital for the global recovery. ""Fortunately, China has policy space to provide macroeconomic policy support, including shifting the focus toward vulnerable households to strengthen consumption, which can also help support China's climate goals by steering economic activity to lower-carbon sectors,"" Georgieva added. ""Stronger policy efforts in the property sector can also help secure a balanced recovery."" At the same venue, China's President Xi Jinping said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed. In light of growing headwinds, foreign brokerages have also been slashing GDP forecasts for China, after weakness in March activity data raised outlook risks as the lockdown in the mega city of Shanghai drags on.

A currency crisis late last year sent inflation soaring and prompted the government to raise prices of everything from gas and electricity to road tolls, alcohol, bus fares and petrol in January.  ""This is not a call for civil disobedience, this is resistance. This is a fight for your rights. My fight is to be the voice of the families and children that are left in the dark,"" Republican People's Party (CHP) Chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu said as he sat beside his wife in his house in Ankara lit by a gas lantern. ""We will be in the dark for a week with my wife ... I will sit in the darkness to experience the pain of my people,"" he also said. Annual inflation rose further to 61% in March. Many analysts blame the economic turmoil on a series of unorthodox interest rate cuts engineered by President Tayyip Erdogan last year. Kilicdaroglu said in February he would stop paying his electricity bills and called for the price hikes to be rolled back. He said earlier on Thursday electricity prices - which went up between 50% and 125% at the beginning of 2022 - had risen more than 400% in three years. Nearly 4 million Turkish subscribers had their power cut in 2021, Kilicdaroglu added without giving a source for that information. The inflationary surge has hit Erdogan's popularity ahead of national elections due no later than June 2023, in which Kilicdaroglu is seen as a potential contender for the presidency.  Years of double-digit inflation in addition to the recent jump have eroded household savings and earnings.

The United States and its allies have ramped up arms shipments to Kyiv ahead of Russia's announced offensive in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow tries to salvage its nearly two-month old campaign. Ukrainian forces have used Western weapons including Stinger and Javelin missiles along with drones, like the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and U.S.-made Switchblade, effectively to target Russian positions. The White House said earlier on Thursday that over 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems would be provided to Ukraine as part of the new arms package.  The Pentagon said the Ghost drones are well suited for the coming fight in Ukraine's Donbas region, which officials have described as flat terrain reminiscent of the U.S. state of Kansas. ""It was developed for a set of requirements that very closely match what the Ukrainians need right now in Donbas,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said, without elaborating. Little else is known about the drones, including their range and precise capabilities, and Kirby declined to offer more details about them. Still, he did say they were designed mainly for striking targets. ""It can also be used to give you a sight picture of what it's seeing, of course. But its principal focus is attack,"" Kirby said.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Special Report: Sanctioned weapons mogul who supplied Russia’s troops has ties to Philip Morris A longtime Russian business associate of American tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc Igor Kesaev, 55, listed by Forbes as Russia’s 35th-richest person last year, was sanctioned April 13 by the United Kingdom and on April 8 by the European Union. The EU noted in its sanctions document that Kesaev’s holdings in tobacco distribution and weapons production are funneling “substantial” revenue to the Russian Federation to fund its “destabilisation of Ukraine.” Kesaev owned a 49% share in the V.A. Degtyarev plant, located 165 miles northeast of Moscow, which makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military and countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, according to Russian business records as of Dec. 31 and the plant’s website. The plant is known for producing Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles. Kesaev’s interest in the weapons business dates back to at least 2012, Degtyarev’s corporate filings show. Kesaev spokesperson Anatoly Shiryaev told Reuters in an emailed statement Wednesday that Kesaev “currently is not a shareholder” in Degtyarev and “isn’t part of its management.” Shiryaev didn’t respond to follow-up questions or requests to provide documentation of Kesaev’s exit from the arms business. The Degtyarev plant’s 2021 annual report - released April 14 - listed Kesaev as holding a 49% stake in the factory. Alexander Tmenov, the plant’s general director, referred to Kesaev as “our main shareholder” in an in-house publication dated March 16 and posted on the Degtyarev facility’s website. In its April 8 sanctions document, the EU referred to Kesaev as “the major shareholder of Degtyarev Plant.” Until recently, Kesaev was also the board chairman of a sprawling Russian tobacco distribution company, TC Megapolis JSC. And he was a board member of that firm's Dutch holding company, in which Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has a 23% stake. Kesaev resigned both posts April 11, according to Philip Morris and a TC Megapolis JSC press release. He retains ultimate control of Megapolis, however, according to the EU. In its sanctions statement, the EU said Kesaev is the president and owner of Mercury Group, which owns Megapolis, “the leading tobacco distributor in Russia.” In his emailed statement, Kesaev spokesperson Shiryaev said the businessman “isn’t part of the Megapolis Group’s management and therefore doesn’t comment on Megapolis' relations with (Philip Morris).” Reuters couldn’t determine the size of Kesaev’s stake in the holding company, Megapolis Distribution BV. A December report from Russia-focused business news service Interfax said Kesaev and a longtime business associate, Sergei Katsiev, together owned 52.8%. The April 11 Megapolis press release said Kesaev is not a controlling or majority shareholder in the distribution company or any of its subsidiaries, and that he doesn’t influence or make decisions about the business. Philip Morris’ ties with Kesaev date to the early 1990s, when the entrepreneur helped the American firm navigate post-Soviet Russia and tap its coveted market of heavy smokers, according to news reports. That relationship could now prove a public-relations nightmare for the company.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"How Australia could help Europe solve its green energy gap April 19 - With the war in Ukraine forcing the European Union to cut its dependence on fossil fuels from Russia, one renewable technology that has come into sharper focus is green hydrogen. Hydrogen produced using renewable energy such as wind and solar instead of natural gas, is viewed as key to decarbonising sectors such as steel, shipping and chemicals. In March, as part of its RePowerEU plan to replace Russian fossil fuel imports, the Commission said it wants to quadruple the existing target in its “Fit for 55” climate plan from 5 million tonnes to 20 million tonnes by 2030. While 10 million tonnes will be sourced locally, a further 10 million will need to be imported, and the Commission announced a “hydrogen accelerator” programme to spur the development of the necessary infrastructure, storage and port facilities. Several countries have already announced plans to become production and export hubs for green hydrogen, including Oman and Chile. But some of the loudest noise is coming from Australia, where there is a string of initiatives to develop gigawatt-scale solar and wind power projects to produce green hydrogen. Just one company, Perth-headquartered Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), aims to be producing 15 million tonnes a year by 2030, and another 50 million a year in the 2030s. It will be used to decarbonise the operations of its parent group, Fortescue Metals, while the rest will be exported. Last year, UK construction company JCB and Ryze Hydrogen committed to take 10% of FFI's green hydrogen production, while in January, ahead of the Russian invasion, FFI announced a deal to supply Germany chemical company Covestro the equivalent of 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 2024 onwards. Last month March FFI, and Germany’s largest energy group, E.ON, announced they were exploring how 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen could be shipped from Australia to Germany. Interviewed before the launch of REPowerEU, Julie Shuttleworth, FFI’s chief executive, said her company is securing projects across the world. “Demand is now much stronger than it was, so we’re very confident that we'll be able to sell it all. In fact, we don't think the world is going to be able to make enough for what we actually need by 2030,” said Shuttleworth. One of the big challenges is the vast amount of renewable energy required to power electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen.

The United States disputed Putin's claim and said it believed Ukrainian forces still held ground in the city. Putin ordered his troops to blockade the steel complex, where Ukrainians were told earlier to either surrender or die. Ukraine said Putin wanted to avoid a final clash with its forces in Mariupol, as he lacked troops to defeat them. But Ukrainian officials also appealed for help to evacuate civilians and wounded soldiers. In a televised meeting at the Kremlin, Putin congratulated his defence minister and Russian troops for having ""successfully completed the combat effort to liberate Mariupol"". He said it was unnecessary to storm the industrial zone containing the Azovstal steel plant. ""There's no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities... Block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can get through,"" Putin said. Mariupol, a major port in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, sits between areas held by Russian separatists and Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow seized in 2014. Capturing the city would allow Russia to link the two areas as it intensifies its offensive in Ukraine's east.  Even as Putin claims his first big prize since his forces were driven away from the capital Kyiv and northern Ukraine last month, it falls short of the unambiguous victory Moscow has sought after months of combat in a city reduced to rubble.

However, there are still 18 projects with a capacity of 19.2 GW that are in a ""gray area"" and could still go ahead, having secured the necessary financing and permits, the Helsinki-based think tank, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said on Friday. President Xi Jinping announced to the United Nations General Assembly in September that China, the world's biggest energy consumer, would end overseas coal projects as part of its contribution to the global effort to cut climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The move was estimated to involve more than $50 billion in investments, but it was unclear at the time whether existing construction plans would go ahead.  However, new guidelines published last month by China's state planning agency have added clarity, and could also encourage the reexamination of another 30 China-backed plants now under construction overseas, involving a total capacity of 30 GW, CREA said. ""Projects under construction... are recommended to proceed 'steadily' and with 'caution',"" CREA said. ""This leaves options open for Chinese firms to withdraw if they have sufficient reason and manageable penalties to do so, particularly if projects are in earlier stages of construction."" The new guidelines indicate that more than a third of all new coal power projects outside of China and India will now be scrapped. “China's new directive is the first of its kind - a large emitter with a major global carbon footprint committing to enable low-carbon transitions overseas,"" said Kevin P.

The warm words from North Korea to President Moon Jae-in came in an exchange of letters less than three weeks before Moon leaves office to be replaced by a conservative leader who has already signalled a tougher line on North Korea Analysts were sceptical that North Korea's message heralded a broader improvement in relations, and warned that the praise for Moon could be a bid to portray his successor, Yoon Suk-yeol, as responsible for any further deterioration in ties.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Biden to unveil new U.S. drug addiction and overdose strategy U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil a new strategy for dealing with drug addiction and overdoses on Thursday that aims to expand access to medications for opioid overdoses, increase funding for law enforcement, and expand sanctions against traffickers. The Biden administration is keen to show it is taking action on a worsening U.S. opioid crisis, which fueled more than an estimated 106,854 drug overdose deaths in the year to November 2021, a 15.6% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. ""That's an American life lost every five minutes around the clock,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. ""For too many years, the overdose crisis has been unraveling the very social fabric of our nation and destroying American lives and livelihoods,"" Gupta told reporters on a press call. The National Drug Control Strategy, which Biden will send to Congress on Thursday, seeks to double treatment admissions for populations that are most at risk of overdose deaths and ensure universal access to medications for opioid use disorder by 2025. Currently, key tools like naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses, and syringe service programs are often restricted or underfunded. There are legal barriers limiting access to naloxone in some states, and even in others the drug is not always available to those most at risk of an overdose. Patients are more likely to receive a naloxone prescription if they had a prior diagnosis of opioid misuse or dependence along with an overdose compared with individuals who had those diagnoses without an overdose. The administration also aims to triple the number of drug traffickers it sanctions and increase border security, said Gupta.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Macron hits below the belt on election campaign trail A day after the gloves came off in a combative debate between Emmanuel Macron and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, the president sparred with a new partner on Thursday as France's election campaign neared its close. On the hunt for votes in a Paris suburb with a strong left-wing vote, Macron dropped into a sports club, rolled up his shirtsleeves and tossed out a few tentative jabs as a boxing coach urged him on. ""Go on, go on, hit me,"" the sports coach encouraged. ""I'm gonna go for it,"" Macron retorted, only to watch his punches miss their target as his opponent ducked and dived out of the way. Support for the president came from bystanders. ""Right between the eyes,"" one man egged Macron on. Instead, the president hit below the belt. Macron maintained his lead over Le Pen ahead of Sunday's run-off vote, a poll showed. Viewers of the only debate between the two final candidates deemed Macron prone to bouts of high-handedness with Le Pen but also found him more convincing and fit to be president.

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Main hospital in Ethiopia's Tigray's region runs out of food The main hospital in Ethiopia's war-ravaged region of Tigray has sent home 240 patients after food supplies ran out last week, officials said. The decision by Ayder Referral Hospital in Tigray's capital Mekelle underscores how little food aid is reaching the region despite the government's declaration in March of a unilateral truce to allow aid deliveries. One hospital official, who asked not to be named, said about 360 patients remained who were able to purchase their own food. New patients without food or money were being turned away, he said. Those who had to leave included babies with meningitis and tuberculosis and a 14-year-old boy with HIV, two nurses told Reuters. Tedros Fissehaye, a pediatrics ward nurse, said patients and their families went hungry on Thursday April 14. On Friday April 15, he had to tour the wards and tell them there would be no more meals. Ten patients left. ""Nobody cried. We have finished our tears for months now. But every nurse was so sad,"" he told Reuters. ""The families said, pray for us, instead of dying here let’s go home and die there."" Another pediatric nurse, Mulu Niguse, said the hospital had run out of 90% of medication, but last month had received some HIV pills and tried to treat other diseases with any antibiotics they could scrounge. The discharged children would likely die, she said. Ethiopia's Minister of Health Lia Tadesse and Mitiku Kassa, head of the National Disaster Risk Management Commission, didn't respond to requests for comment. Conflict erupted in November 2020 between the central government and Tigray's rulers. Since the military pulled out of Tigray in July following months of bloody battles, only a tiny trickle of food aid has entered. The United Nations has said 100 trucks of aid are needed daily. But convoys have struggled to pass, partly due to fighting and partly due to bureaucratic delays. Since the government's ceasefire announced on March 25, 71 trucks have made it in, said Michael Dunford, regional head of the United Nations' World Food Programme.

The industry is expected to post an annual average growth rate of 5.8% from 2022 to 2032 versus the 2.7% increase in global GDP, and create 126 million new jobs, WTTC said in a report released during the industry group's conference in Manila. In 2019, tourism accounted for a tenth of global GDP and jobs but the coronavirus pandemic decimated the $9.6 trillion industry, halving its output value and leaving 62 million people jobless. ""The recovery is going to be so stellar that it's going to recover really powerfully. This does depend of course on China reopening,"" said WTTC President Julia Simpson, calling on all governments to reopen borders. China's ""zero COVID"" policy and persistent lockdowns have disrupted global trade and domestic and international travel. The travel and tourism industry's GDP is seen hitting $8.35 trillion this year and $9.6 trillion in 2023, a return to its pre-pandemic level. Tourism jobs are projected to recover to 300 million this year and 324 million in 2023, close to the 333 million seen in 2019, WTTC said. In Asia-Pacific alone, the hospitality industry's GDP will likely hit $3.4 trillion in 2023, already above the $3.3 trillion it saw in 2019, it said. Compared with North America and Europe, travel has trailed in Asia-Pacific because of strict border restrictions in many countries. In Southeast Asia, travellers are now getting back on planes as the region's entry and COVID-19 quarantine rules are lifted. But a full recovery will be slow, industry members say.

On the second day of a tour of Baltic states, Baerbock addressed criticism by allies and commentators of Germany's apparent foot-dragging on delivering the weaponry Kyiv says it needs to fend off Russian attacks. L5N2WJ3HG ""There are no taboos for us with regard to armoured vehicles and other weaponry that Ukraine needs,"" she told a news conference with her Estonian counterpart on Thursday. Earlier, Bild newspaper had accused Chancellor Olaf Scholz of blocking tank deliveries. Many analysts say Ukraine urgently needs heavy weapons to drive back a Russian invasion that has now concentrated on taking ground in the eastern Donbas region. While Ukraine's light armaments and tactics have had some success in slowing Russia's advance, stopping and reversing that incursion will need heavy battlefield weaponry like tanks and howitzers, they say. Russia calls its incursion a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an illegal war of aggression.  But Baerbock said the priority was to ensure Ukraine quickly got older Soviet-designed kit that its military could use without extra training, and that it was doing this by backfilling the stocks of allied countries that had such weaponry to spare with modern German-made gear. Germany has agreed such an exchange with Slovenia, a Berlin government source told Reuters.

Minister Ahmed Hussen, asked about imposing further measures to slow investor activity such as requiring larger down-payments for second, third or subsequent homes, did not rule out the option. ""We are curbing speculation by doing a number of things ... but also we haven't closed the door to further measures,"" Hussen told Reuters in an interview. He noted that Canada's tax and real estate systems are complex, which complicates the process. ""We have to study further and really examine closely what further measures we can take to deal with issues around speculation,"" he said. Housing prices have surged more than 50% in the last two years, driven by low interest rates, a desire for more space and speculative activity. The Bank of Canada found investors now buy one in every five homes. Hot housing helped drive Canada's inflation rate to a 31-year high in March. Price and sales growth are expected to stay elevated this year, but moderate by late 2023 or early 2024, Canada's national housing agency said Thursday.  To curb speculation, the government is putting in place a temporary ban on foreign buyers and a new measure to more fully tax properties resold within a year of purchase.  Under the current tax system, a home buyer who leaves property empty only to sell it a few months later is taxed the same as the one who owns a property and rents it out for decades, before selling. ""Right now our tax system treats two scenarios the same, and we have to change that,"" said Hussen. The minister was confident that the ban on foreign buyers, which will be in effect for at least two years, will ""certainly create more homes for Canadians.""",1 week ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-open-more-measures-curb-housing-speculation-minister-says-2022-04-21/

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Analysis: Peru's Castillo hardens stance on mining protests as economy stumbles Peru's leftist President Pedro Castillo has signaled a tougher stance on protests against mining companies that are roiling the Andean nation, the world's second largest copper producer, mobilizing the army in a sharp tactical shift from a previous conciliatory approach. Mining activity has been halted at Southern Copper Corp's (SCCO.N) Cuajone since late February as protesters from the mostly indigenous surrounding communities demand financial compensation and a share of future profits. The government on Wednesday announced a state of emergency at the Cuajone mine, saying it would send military forces and suspend the right to protest at the mine that has been shuttered for over 50 days.  That's a significant pivot by Castillo, a former teacher who rode into office last year backed by voters in poor mining districts hoping for a greater share of Peru's mineral wealth. He has avoided clashing with protesters despite a series of blockades that have hit the country's main export sector. ""The problem has to be solved now,"" Peru's Prime Minister Anibal Torres said on Wednesday, citing ""irrational"" community demands at Cuajone, including asking for $5 billion in payments. ""That has led us to declare a state of emergency."" Meanwhile, last week residents of the indigenous Fuerabamba community pitched tents just feet away from Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's (1208.HK) huge Las Bambas open pit copper deposit. The protests have taken a combined 20% of Peru's copper production offline at a time when the Andean country is battling slower growth amid high global inflation. ""Under this administration there are a greater number of mining protests and they are more serious,"" said Pablo O'Brien, a mining expert who worked as an adviser to several mining ministers, including under Castillo. ""The protests last longer than they ever did and they have spread to regions where you didn't see social conflicts before."" Protests have also hit other mines in Peru since Castillo came to office last July, including the Anglo-Swiss Glencore's (GLEN.L) Antapaccay, and Canada-based Hudbay Minerals Inc's (HBM.TO) Constancia and Antamina mines, co-owned by Glencore and the Anglo-Australian miner BHP (BHP.AX).",1 week ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/perus-castillo-hardens-stance-mining-protests-economy-stumbles-2022-04-21/

2022-04-21,Reuters,"Factbox: What is the special tax designation Disney might lose? A Florida bill that would eliminate the special tax district that gives the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) the ability to govern its theme parks won approval from lawmakers on Thursday, sending the legislation to Governor Ron DeSantis for his signature. Disney's designation has allowed the company to control the area including and surrounding Walt Disney World, comprised of an array of theme parks, hotels, golf courses and other entertainment venues.  Here is what is at stake for Disney: WHAT IS THE SPECIAL TAXING DISTRICT AND WHY WAS IT SET UP? The Florida State legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement District in 1967 to promote the development of Walt Disney World on a 38.5-square mile patch of pasture and swamp land in Central Florida. Disney pays taxes to the Reedy Creek Improvement District and two counties its resort straddles, Orange and Osceola. The district, in turn, provides services, including fire response, emergency medical services, water and sewage treatment, and can issue municipal bonds to finance infrastructure projects, which comes with tax advantages. In practice, the arrangement gives Disney control over municipal services and autonomy when it comes to how the land is used and developed, exempting it from some regulations. Walt Disney World paid $780.3 million in state and local taxes in 2021. Dissolving the district would mean the company could no longer finance improvements through municipal bonds, which carry tax advantages. It’s unclear what that would mean for Disney’s operating costs. The legislation might end up increasing the tax burden on Orange and Osceola residents, who would have to foot the bill for all the services Disney pays for through the special district, including roads, fire service and water. They might also have to pick up the tab for $58 million in debt service. The move marks the culmination of a feud between the company and DeSantis, who began targeting Disney after it criticized legislation that bars classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in the state's primary schools and prohibits teachings ""not age appropriate"" for other grades.",1 week ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-special-tax-designation-disney-might-lose-2022-04-22/

The ICJ ruled that Colombian activities in the Nicaraguan zone, including giving out fishing rights to others and interfering with maritime research, violated Nicaragua's sovereign rights. In 2012, the world court handed down a judgment that reduced the expanse of sea belonging to Colombia. The new sea borders increased Nicaragua's continental shelf and economic exclusion zone in the Caribbean, giving it access to underwater oil and gas deposits, as well as fishing rights in those waters.  The judges on Thursday also ordered Colombia to amend a 2013 presidential decree that established a zone around Colombian islands in the disputed area. According to the court, the zone, as mentioned in the decree, is too large and the powers Colombia says it has in the document are not in line with customary international law. After the ruling, a representative of the Colombian government said he did not see it as a victory for Nicaragua because not all Managua's requests were granted. ""We are satisfied with today's ruling,"" Carlos Arrieta Padilla told journalists outside the court. He added that Colombia cannot implement aspects of the ruling before going through a ""special procedure"".

On Tuesday, Reuters reported Mexico had disbanded the group that for a quarter of a century worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to tackle organized crime.  The closure complicates U.S. efforts to help combat organized crime inside Mexico, one of the epicenters of the multi-billion dollar global narcotics trade, and makes it harder to catch and prosecute cartel leaders, security experts say. Speaking at a regular news conference, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the unit was shut down ""over a year ago"" and that cooperation with international security bodies was continuing, provided Mexico's sovereignty was respected.

Employees can contribute up to 12,000 yuan ($1,860) per year to their pension fund under the new scheme, which will be rolled out with one-year trials in some cities before being implemented nationwide, the government said in a policy document on its website. Until now, both employees and employers have contributed fixed amounts under state pension plans. The milestone marks the official launch of China's private pension sector after almost four years of pilots, and is expected to spur foreign insurers and asset managers to accelerate their expansion into the world's most populous nation.

Yellen told a news conference that she shared the aid plans during a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday. ""The needs of Ukraine are urgent, and we plan to deploy this direct aid to Ukraine as soon as possible,"" Yellen said. ""We know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild, and I'm committed to working with Congress and our international allies and partners to build on this support in the medium and long term."" The new aid will help Ukraine pay government salaries, pensions and fund social programs necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of its southwestern neighbor. Yellen said the $1 billion in direct aid will require the Biden administration to make a supplemental budget request to Congress and she was committed to asking lawmakers for further help for Ukraine. ""We've got to find ways to meet Ukraine's needs,"" she said. Shmyhal, who is in Washington to attend the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, is also due to meet with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Later, he is due to address an event hosted by the World Bank about Ukraine's financing needs. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday said that Ukrainian government estimates that the country needs $5 billion in aid per month to keep its economy operating seem accurate, and the immediate priority was filling that gap for over the next three months. The World Bank last week estimated that half of Ukraine's businesses are closed, the rest are operating at well below capacity and its GDP this year will collapse by 45% as Russia's invasion rages.

Binance told users that Russian nationals and people living in the country, as well as companies based there, that hold crypto worth over 10,000 euros ($10,900), would be banned from making new deposits or trading. Affected clients would however be able to withdraw funds, it said. Accounts for Russia-linked users that have completed address checks and hold crypto worth less than 10,000 euros would remain active, Binance added. In its fifth package of sanctions on Russia, the EU this month targeted digital wallets used to store, send, receive and spend cryptocurrencies, part of broader efforts to close potential loopholes that could allow Russians to move money abroad.  Binance, along with major U.S. exchanges Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Kraken, had rejected calls from Kyiv for a total ban on Russian users after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Binance said in March it would not ""unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users' accounts"", but that it would ensure compliance with sanctions.

The shrine honours 2.5 million war dead including 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal. It is seen by China, South Korea and others as a symbol of Japanese aggression before and during World War Two. Many Japanese pay respects to relatives at Yasukuni and conservatives say leaders should be able to honour the dead there. But past visits and offerings have provoked angry responses from Asian neighbours. Kishida has recently followed the example of previous Japanese leaders by refraining from visiting in person during spring and autumn festivals to avoid stirring anger, instead sending an offering, as he did on Thursday. Japan's top government spokesman, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, declined to comment. While Kishida stayed away, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and current ruling Liberal Democratic Party policy chief Sanae Takaichi did visit the shrine. South Korea expressed ""deep disappointment and regret"". ""Japan's responsible leaders have once again sent offerings to and paid respects at the Yasukuni Shrine which glorifies Japan's history of war of aggression and enshrines war criminals,"" South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Today, in a conversation with the city defenders, a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison,"" he said.

Brazil, with a current output of around 3 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), has been increasing production for years and is aiming for a 10% increase to 3.3 million bpd in 2022. Asked if the United States had reached out to talk about potential production increases, Albuquerque said the two countries were cooperating. ""I already had two meetings with energy secretary (Jennifer) Granholm, and we have been talking about this, the importance to stabilize the offer and demand of oil and gas around the world,"" he said. Albuquerque's comments underline the breadth of the Biden administration's diplomatic campaign to find alternatives to Russian crude. Albuquerque, however, said a dramatic short-term boost would be logistically difficult. ""To increase production is not like a switch you can turn.

The U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A deal with Rwanda would make Denmark the first European Union member to effectively bypass the bloc's fragmented migration and asylum system. ""Our dialogue with the Rwandan government includes a mechanism for the transfer of asylum seekers,"" Immigration Minister Mattias Tesfaye told Reuters on Wednesday. The deal would aim to ""ensure a more dignified approach than the criminal network of human traffickers that characterises migration across the Mediterranean today,"" he added. Denmark, which has introduced increasingly harsh immigration policies in the last decade, passed a law last year that allows refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country.  The move drew criticism from human rights advocates, the United Nations and the European Commission but Denmark failed to find a partner country at that time. Last week, Britain announced it planned to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda in a move aimed at smashing people-smuggling networks and stemming the flow of migrants.  Over the last year, Denmark has approached countries both in and outside the European Union about a potential asylum deal, including Tunisia and Ethiopia. Denmark also signed a diplomatic agreement with Rwanda last year on asylum and political matters. The EU Commission has said relocating refugees outside Europe is ""not possible"" under current EU rules but Denmark is exempt from some EU rules, including asylum standards, due to an opt-out.

""The two recorders on the plane were severely damaged due to the impact, and the data restoration and analysis work is still in progress,"" CAAC said in a statement.

2022-04-20,Reuters,"Exclusive: Ex-CIA analyst says she ‘got bloodied’ in tangled U.S. war on Al Qaeda In the 2012 Hollywood hit “Zero Dark Thirty,” a red-haired Central Intelligence Agency analyst played by Jessica Chastain travels to a secret CIA prison and watches a colleague waterboard a screaming Al Qaeda suspect, then lock him in a box a little bigger than a mini-fridge, to make him talk. In 2002, red-haired CIA analyst Alfreda Scheuer, then known by her maiden name Bikowsky, traveled to a secret CIA prison to watch the torture of Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded and locked in a “dog box,” Senate investigators reported. The Central Intelligence Agency had granted the filmmakers unprecedented access to agency officials, and outlets from NBC News to The New Yorker reported that Chastain’s character was patterned partially on Scheuer, citing her position but omitting her name because the agency said her work was classified. For two decades Scheuer was a central figure in some of the major controversies of America’s war on Islamist extremist groups, including secret detention centers and brutal interrogations. CIA operatives normally operate in a dark, shadowy world, but Scheuer’s experiences found the spotlight. Scheuer retired from her most recent role as deputy chief of Homeland and Strategic Threats late in 2021 and agreed to talk to Reuters this year. It’s the first interview she’s ever done, she said, and she decided to speak to make clear she was not forced out of the agency but left on her own terms. By policy, the CIA doesn’t discuss individual employees or confirm whether they worked at the agency. Over several calls that lasted two and half hours, Scheuer said she couldn’t discuss individual cases because they were classified. But in a broad sense, she said waterboarding cited in government reports was not torture, insisted such techniques can work and said any criticism of her was largely the result of her taking risks to combat terrorism. “I got bloodied,” she said, alluding to criticism of her agency in government and media reports, “and kept coming back to try again and again to do something. I'm proud that I wasn't on the sidelines. I didn't bury my head in the sand.” The New Yorker once dubbed Scheuer, again citing her position but omitting her name, as the “Queen of Torture,” writing that “she gleefully participated in torture sessions.” Scheuer called the description, which found its way into multiple media reports, false and a caricature. She believes a male operative would not have been described the same way. “I got that title because I was in the arena,” she said. “In fact, I raised my hand loud and proud and you know, I don't regret it at all.”",1 week ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-ex-cia-analyst-says-she-got-bloodied-tangled-us-war-al-qaeda-2022-04-20/
2022-04-20,Reuters,"Siemens Gamesa buffeted by rising costs as turbine launch problems deepen Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC) is trying to raise wind turbine prices to cope with lofty raw materials costs and iron out complex internal procedures that have delayed new products and helped trigger a huge quarterly loss, Chief Executive Jochen Eickholt said on Wednesday. His comments came after the world's largest maker of offshore wind turbines flagged deeper than expected problems launching a new generation of onshore turbines as well as higher costs, causing it to pull its 2022 outlook and put it under review.  Shares in the company fell as much as 5.4% on the news, while parent Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE), which owns 67% of Siemens Gamesa, dropped as much as 6.9% after saying it also had to review its annual forecast for sales and profits. Wind turbine makers are struggling to protect their margins as the prices of vital components soar, even though there is strong global demand for renewable energy capacity to stem planet-warming carbon emissions. ""For specific materials ... steel, copper, others, ... the price peak we kind of reached is kind of still in existence,"" said Eickholt, a former Siemens Energy board member who took the helm of the wind turbine maker in March to get the problems under control. Eickholt, in a call with analysts after presenting a 304 million euro ($329 million) second-quarter operating loss, said there ""were quite a number of underestimated complexities"" delaying the launch of the company's new 5X onshore wind turbine. ""The needed design stability, the needed design maturity, that is what we are on delay with, in conjunction with then ramping up also manufacturing capacities,"" he said. The problems with internal processes have led to frustration at Siemens Energy for quite some time, raising pressure on management to intervene and fix the situation, possibly by acquiring the remaining stake or replacing key leadership.  ""Two thirds of the difficulties are internal root causes,"" Eickholt said, adding solving these could not be achieved quickly. Eickholt said the company was trying to negotiate price increases ""in the range of between a high single-digit percentage and perhaps even above"".",1 week ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/siemens-gamesa-buffeted-by-rising-costs-turbine-launch-problems-deepen-2022-04-20/

Relations between China and the United States have been tense, with the world's two largest economies clashing over everything from Taiwan and China's human rights record to its military activity in the South China Sea. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the two talked about relations between the countries and ""regional security issues, and Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine."" Despite the tensions and heated rhetoric, U.S. military officials have long sought to have open lines of communication with their Chinese counterparts to be able to mitigate potential flare-ups or deal with any accidents. Austin, despite multiple attempts, had been unable to talk with Chinese military leaders until Wednesday. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition anonymity, said the call, which lasted about 45 minutes, did not have any major breakthroughs but Austin reiterated the importance of Beijing not arming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. A statement from Beijing said that Wei told Austin that Taiwan was a part of China and no one could change that. ""If the Taiwan issue were not handled properly, it would have a damaging impact on Sino-U.S. relations,"" Wei added, according to statement published by the defense ministry.

2022-04-20,Reuters,"European Commission analysing higher 45% renewable energy target for 2030 The European Commission is assessing whether the European Union could achieve a higher target of a 45% share of renewable energy by 2030, instead of its proposed 40%, to accelerate its shift from Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine. ""We are working on it full speed to take account, first of all the proposal of going from 40% to 45%, but also in the context of higher energy prices,"" Mechthild Woersdoerfer, deputy director-general of the Commission's energy department, told a meeting of EU lawmakers on Wednesday. Russia is the EU's top gas supplier, and the 40% renewable energy goal for 2030 was proposed by the Commission last year. The EU got 22% of its gross final energy consumption from renewables like wind, solar and biomass in 2020. The share varies widely between EU countries, ranging from more than 50% in Sweden to below 10% in Luxembourg. The new target will depend on EU countries and the European Parliament, which are negotiating it as part of a major package of climate change laws to cut EU emissions faster. A 45% renewable goal already has support from the EU assembly's lead negotiator and renewable industry groups such as SolarPower Europe - although industry has urged Brussels to do more to unblock years-long permitting delays.  Markus Pieper, Parliament's lead lawmaker, said the new analysis was needed urgently so it could inform the ongoing negotiations, and urged the Commission not to wait until after the summer. ""Otherwise we'll be starting again from the beginning,"" he said. Brussels estimates tripling the EU wind and solar capacity by 2030, adding 480GW of wind and 420GW of solar energy, could save 170 bcm of gas demand a year. The Commission will publish a plan in May to quit Russian fossil fuels by 2027.

2022-04-20,Reuters,"Denmark proposes corporate carbon tax to meet climate target Denmark's government on Wednesday proposed introducing a uniform carbon tax for companies as a way to reach the country's ambitious climate target. The proposed carbon tax of 1,125 Danish crowns ($164.21) per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent would cut carbon emissions by 3.7 million tonnes per year by 2030, the government said. The tax, which includes a projected 2030 price of EU carbon permits of 750 Danish crowns per tonne, would be imposed on heavy industries and the energy sector, it said. For smaller companies that are not part of the EU emissions trading system, the government proposed a tax of 750 crowns per tonne. ""This initiative is meant to ensure that the companies that impact the climate pay for their own emissions,"" Tax Minister Jeppe Bruus said. The government also proposed spending 7 billion crowns to help companies with the green transition, thus minimizing the risk that they move abroad to avoid the carbon tax, Bruus said. The proposal would provide a reduced tax rate for cement and stone wool industries, which include Denmark's biggest polluter, cement producer Aalborg Portland. The measure could help Denmark, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, to achieve its 2030 target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 70% from 1990 levels, or around 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said separate letters were handed to the permanent missions of Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday afternoon asking Putin to receive Guterres in Moscow and Zelenskiy to receive him in Kyiv. ""The Secretary-General said, at this time of great peril and consequence, he would like to discuss urgent steps to bring about peace in Ukraine and the future of multilateralism based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law,"" Dujarric said in a statement. Guterres on Tuesday called for a four-day Orthodox Easter humanitarian pause in fighting in Ukraine to allow for the safe passage of civilians to leave areas of conflict and the delivery of humanitarian aid to hard-hit areas.  Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has killed or wounded thousands.

2022-04-20,Reuters,"U.S. appeals court will not reconsider California net neutrality ruling A U.S. Court of Appeals on Wednesday said it will not reconsider its decision in January to uphold California's net neutrality law. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January ruled 3-0 that a 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reverse federal internet protections could not bar state action, rejecting a challenge from telecom and broad industry groups to block California's net neutrality law, which aims to protect the open internet. The appeals court on Wednesday rejected a petition for a rehearing by the full court. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a senior counselor at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society said it was ""notable that not a single judge on the nation’s largest court of appeals even asked for a vote on the industry’s rehearing petition."" Telecom groups could now ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The court in January said since the FCC reclassified internet services in 2017 as more lightly regulated information services, the commission ""no longer has the authority to regulate in the same manner that it had when these services were classified as telecommunications services."" A lower court judge refused to block California's net neutrality law from taking effect after the Justice Department withdrew its separate legal challenge to California's state law in February 2021.  California's 2018 law barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes, but it only took effect last year. The FCC under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had adopted net neutrality rules in 2015. They were overturned in 2017 by the FCC under President Donald Trump, a Republican. California's legislature responded by adopting a state law requiring net neutrality in August 2018. Supporters of net neutrality rules argue that the protections ensure a free and open internet. Broadband and telecoms trade groups contend their legal basis from the pre-internet era was outdated and would discourage investment. The FCC remains divided 2-2. Democrats have been unable to launch proceedings to reinstate net neutrality. In March, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 14-14 to advance the nomination of Gigi Sohn to serve on the FCC. The full U.S. Senate must hold a ""discharge"" vote on the nominations in addition to a final confirmation vote.

2022-04-20,Reuters,"Philippines' poll body throws out last petition against Marcos The Philippines' poll body on Wednesday cleared a major legal hurdle in frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s path to the presidency when it dismissed the final petition calling for his disqualification from the May 9 election. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) ruled that a case calling for Marcos to be barred from the contest based on his failure to file income tax returns lacked merit. ""Regardless of the fact that the non-filing of income tax return was done repeatedly by the respondent, there is still no tax evasion to speak of as no tax was actually intentionally evaded,"" the COMELEC's first division said in the ruling. ""The government was not defrauded."" Five other cases seeking to keep Marcos from running were also earlier dismissed by the poll body. These are now under appeal and could be escalated to the Supreme Court. ""Of course it is a good development and we are happy that it happened before our actual elections,"" Marcos told reporters while campaigning. The petitioners did not respond to a request for comment. Marcos, 64, has consistently topped opinion polls but saw his lead over his closest rival, Leni Robredo, narrow in a March survey. His refusal to pay a tax bill on the estate of his father, the late authoritarian ruler Ferdinand Marcos, could impact his popularity, said political analyst Ramon Casiple. ""He was defeated by Leni Robredo in the vice presidential race in 2016 and it might happen again,"" he said. Analysts say his high ratings in surveys are partly thanks to a strong social media presence aimed at the youth, who were not yet born when the senior Marcos was in power.

2022-04-19,Reuters,"Analysis: Wealth shock - property bust in small Chinese cities rattles households Home owners in small Chinese cities are battling a rare property market downdraft as buyers keep away, eroding the wealth of millions in a blow to already brittle consumer confidence in the world's second-largest economy. Smaller cities have been hammered by falling home prices for seven months since September, the latest tally of 70 major cities by China's statistics bureau shows. Yet this contraction is just the tip of the iceberg. The bureau's data does not fully capture the property malaise across the roughly 300 cities classified as third-tier or lower, or even include the 2,000 smaller county-level cities and 40,000 towns. By some estimates, small cities and towns account for around 1 billion of China's 1.44 billion population. Buyer sentiment has broadly sagged since 2021 after a government crackdown on new borrowing by indebted developers sparked a liquidity crisis. Nationwide home prices fell late last year for the first time since 2015.  The negative wealth effect of depreciating home prices has rippled through to consumer confidence, curbing the desire to spend even on basic goods such as clothing. Consumption has already been ravaged by COVID-19 outbreaks that locked down cities and disrupted local economies. Nationwide retail sales fell in March for the first time since 2020 while joblessness in 31 major cities hit a record.  ""For Chinese consumers to come back full force, not only will the virus need to be vanquished, but the property sector will need to revive as well,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economics research at HSBC in Hong Kong. ""Especially in China's smaller cities, property often accounts for a substantial part of household wealth, with any sign of weakness in the local real estate market dampening consumer confidence and weakening retail sales."" In the first quarter, China's overall consumption per capita rose 5.7% on-year, slowing sharply from 17.6% growth in the year-earlier quarter.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/wealth-shock-property-bust-small-chinese-cities-rattles-households-2022-04-20/

Demonstrations have raged across the South Asian island country of 22 million people for weeks, voicing anger against the government's mishandling of the economy that has led to shortages of essentials and prolonged power cuts. Mihiri Priyangani, director of the Kegalle Teaching Hospital, said at least one protester was killed and 12 injured were hospitalised, including two in critical condition, after clashes broke out between demonstrators and police in the central town of Rambukkana. The deceased person - the first fatality since the largely peaceful protests began last month - had likely been shot, Priyangani told Reuters. ""We are suspecting gunshot injuries but need a post-mortem to confirm the exact cause of death."" Disturbances erupted after police asked protesters to move away from a key railway line which they had blocked for hours, police spokesman Nalin Thalduwa said. ""To control the situation, police fired at the protesters,"" Thalduwa told Reuters. ""Several injured policemen have also been hospitalised,"" he said, adding live ammunition and tear gas had been used to repel a crowd pelting stones and other objects. ""Police are still in the area and attempting to restore calm.""

2022-04-19,Reuters,"Analysis: Demand for Pfizer's COVID pills lags around the world Worldwide demand for Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment Paxlovid has been unexpectedly light due to complicated eligibility requirements, reduced testing, and potential for drug interactions, a Reuters review of data and interviews with experts has found. Demand also has been hampered by the perception that Omicron infections are not that severe. Paxlovid was expected to be a major tool in the fight against COVID after it reduced hospitalizations or deaths in high-risk patients by around 90% in a clinical trial. Thousands of people still die from COVID-19 every week, even as global infections are far off their peak. And there are only a few proven antiviral treatments, of which Paxlovid is the most attractive. The others are Merck & Co's (MRK.N) far less effective rival pill molnupiravir, and Gilead Sciences' (GILD.O) intravenous remdesivir. But even amid a recent rise in infections, Paxlovid supply far outstripped demand in the United States, UK, Japan, and South Korea, data from health ministries and Reuters interviews with doctors and pharmacists found. ""We're just not seeing as many people coming in for testing,"" said Dr. Timothy Hendrix, senior medical director of AdventHealth Centra Care in Florida, which has more than 40 urgent care locations. Hendrix said he had not prescribed Paxlovid in a few weeks. Eligible patients have turned down prescription, because they believe the Omicron variant causes mild illness. ""Most of our patients (say) ... 'I'm just going to go home and tough this out,'"" Hendrix said. Pfizer plans to produce up to 120 million courses of Paxlovid this year and expects at least $22 billion in sales from contracts signed through early February. The United States, which agreed to buy up to 20 million pills this year, making it the largest publicly known buyer, is paying around $530 a course, but prices vary by country. Pfizer is on pace to produce 3.5 million courses earmarked for U.S. use by the end of April, the government said. Through the first half of April, U.S. data shows it has distributed around 1.5 million courses and that pharmacies still have over 500,000 available.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/demand-pfizers-covid-pills-lags-around-world-2022-04-19/

Thousands of Russian troops backed by artillery and rocket barrages were advancing in what Ukrainian officials called the Battle of the Donbas. Russia's nearly eight-week-long invasion has taken longer than many expected while still failing to capture any of the biggest cities, forcing Moscow to refocus in and around separatist regions. The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has, however, seen nearly 5 million people flee abroad and reduced cities to rubble as the incursion drags on.

2022-04-19,Reuters,"Earnings boost Wall Street while growth fears sink oil U.S. stocks surged Tuesday on the back of stronger than expected corporate earnings, but bleak forecasts on global economic growth pushed up bond yields and drove down oil. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way for gains in U.S. markets, as many corporations began to report stronger than expected earnings. Those reports helped investors shake off warnings from global forecasters of a slowdown in economic growth, which weighed on other sectors like bonds and oil. Of the 49 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings as of Tuesday, nearly 80% have topped profit estimates, per Refinitiv data.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 1.45%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 1.61% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) jumped 2.15%. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 45 nations, was up 0.81%. The surge came even as global economic bodies began to air warnings on economic growth. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund slashed their global economic outlooks for 2022 by nearly a full percentage point, citing turmoil emanating from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the pitched battle against inflation worldwide.  The current battle by central banks worldwide to curb inflation continued to boost bond markets, where U.S. Treasury yields continued to move upward.

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard repeated his case for raising rates to 3.5% by the year-end on Monday, adding a 75 basis-point hike should not be discounted, although this was not his base case.

2022-04-19,Reuters,"Philippines has potential for 21GW wind power by 2040, World Bank says The Philippines has the potential to install 21 gigawatt of offshore wind power by 2040, equivalent to about a fifth of its electricity supply by then, according to a study released by the Department of Energy and the World Bank on Wednesday. The installation of more wind power will help cut the country's dependence on fossil fuels, which in 2020 accounted for about 79% of its power generation mix, government data showed. Renewable energy only had a 21% share of the energy mix in 2020, down from 34% in 2008, with solar, wind and biomass together accounting for a little less than 4%. Coal accounted for nearly 60% of the 2020 mix as many energy producers opted for projects using the fuel. The government aims to increase the share of renewable energy to 35% by 2030 and to 50% by 2040. The push comes as the Philippines, which is vulnerable to weather-related disasters sometimes linked to climate change, has pledged a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  ""The Philippines' waters have conditions that are well-suited to offshore wind,"" said Ndiamé Diop, World Bank country director for Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. But there are challenges establishing a wind power industry in the Philippines at a large scale, such as cost, transmission, logistics, financing and ownership issues, World Bank officials said. Offshore wind is more expensive than other forms of renewable energy. To drive down costs, transmission grid upgrades will be required to connect projects at large scale, they said, noting additional risks associated with gaining investments in this area and with foreign ownership limited to 40%.

Poland, along with other EU members, has been receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the coronavirus pandemic under supply contracts agreed between the European Commission and vaccine makers such as BioNTech SE (22UAy.DE) and Pfizer (PFE.N) or Moderna (MRNA.O). Poland's biggest supplier is Pfizer. However, the country has seen lower vaccine uptake than most of the European Union and has surplus vaccine stock, part of which it has sold or donated to other countries.

""Indeed, the consequence of this will be a legal conflict, which is already taking place,"" he said. Poland cannot directly terminate the contract for the supply of vaccines as the parties to the contracts are the European Commission and manufacturers, he said. The value of the contract for vaccine supplies to Poland up to the end of 2023 with one producer alone was worth over 6 billion zlotys ($1.4 billion), with over 2 billion zlotys of that for supply in 2022. Pfizer said its agreement over the supply of its COVID-19 vaccine to European Union member states was with the EU Commission.

The group was one of the Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) operating in about 15 countries which U.S. officials tout as invaluable in dismantling powerful smuggling rings and busting countless drug lords around the globe. The units are trained by the DEA but under the control of national governments. In Mexico, the over 50 officers in the SIU police unit were considered many of the country's best and worked on the biggest cases such as the 2016 capture of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, then the boss of the powerful Sinaloa cartel. The closure threatens to imperil U.S. efforts to combat organized crime groups inside Mexico, one of the epicenters of the multi-billion dollar global narcotics trade, and make it harder to catch and prosecute cartel leaders. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government formally notified the DEA in April last year that the unit had been shut down, according to a DEA agent with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak about the issue. A second source familiar with the situation confirmed the closure of the unit. Mexico's Public Security Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The DEA declined to comment. The closure of the unit was not reported before. Reuters was unable to find out why the Mexican government did not announce it publicly at the time. ""They strangled it,"" the agent said, referring to the unit. ""It shatters the bridges we spent decades putting together."" The closure could prove costly on U.S. streets, where authorities are battling to reduce a surge in overdoses that last year led to more than 100,000 deaths mostly linked to a new wave of synthetic drugs produced by Mexican cartels. The elite team, founded in 1997, was the main conduit for the DEA to share leads on drugs shipments and tips obtained on U.S. soil with Mexico's government.

Even before the war, over 800 million people - or 10% of the global population - were suffering from chronic food insecurity, Yellen said, and estimates showed higher food prices alone could push at least 10 million more people into poverty. Yellen told a high-level panel countries should avoid export bans that could further boost prices, while stepping up support for vulnerable populations and smallholder farmers, a message underscored by German Finance Minister Christian Lindner.

The plea came as some people refused to join PCR testing queues out of weariness after weeks of such requirements, or fear it puts them at greater risk of infection. Residents shared stories on social media about busloads of people being taken from their homes and sent into quarantine, including babies and the elderly. Authorities are under pressure from Beijing to speed up transfers of positive cases and their close contacts to quarantine centres, fuelling fears about measures designed to completely stop the spread of the virus rather than just slow it down. China, where the coronavirus was first identified in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, has opted for a ""zero tolerance"" policy, rather than trying to live with the virus in the community. ""By conducting multiple, consecutive rounds of PCR testing we will be able to dynamically detect positive cases as early as possible, as this will help us to reach zero-COVID at community level more quickly,"" city health official Hu Xiaobo said. Sources have told Reuters that Shanghai aims to stop the spread of COVID-19 outside quarantined areas by Wednesday. The target marked a turning point when achieved by other locked-down Chinese cities, allowing them to ease curbs. The number of new local transmissions detected on Monday fell to 19,442 from 21,395 the previous day. Shanghai found 550 cases outside the quarantine zones, down from 561 the day before and the fourth consecutive decline. While Shanghai has not yet said how it will open up, it is working towards that goal by carrying out daily PCR and antigen testing for millions and accelerating quarantine transfers. China's COVID elimination strategy requires testing, tracing and centrally quarantining all positive cases and their close contacts. While tens of thousands of people have already been sent to isolation facilities, many more are forced to isolate in their homes due to their proximity to infected people.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/shanghai-steps-up-quarantine-transfers-new-covid-cases-decline-2022-04-19/

So, I guess Mariupol will be controlled in the coming days,"" the European official told U.S. reporters. Local authorities say thousands of people have been killed in the siege of Mariupol and Russia has given the last Ukrainian defenders at a steel works an ultimatum to surrender or die. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow denies targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, which it claims is aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and rooting out dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and the West dismiss Russia's stance as a pretext for an unprovoked invasion. The European official said he believed Russia's medium-term objective was to control the Luhansk and Donetsk territories in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and to secure a landbridge between Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014, and the Donbas. This would likely take four to six months, the official said, adding that the conflict could then result in a stalemate.

2022-04-19,Reuters,"China imports 13% less crude oil from Saudi in March, 14% less from Russia Saudi Arabia exported nearly 13% less oil to China in March than a year earlier but retained its top supplier spot, while shipments from second-ranking Russia slipped 14%, Reuters' calculations based on Chinese customs data showed. Saudi crude arrivals totalled 6.858 million tonnes last month, equivalent to 1.61 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data from the General Administration of Customs. That compared to an average of 1.81 million bpd during the first two months and 1.85 million bpd a year earlier. Imports from Russia were at 6.39 million tonnes, or 1.5 million bpd, versus 1.75 million bpd in March 2021 and 1.57 million bpd in the January-February period. The lower supplies from these two exporters came as China's overall crude imports last month fell 14% on year as independent refiners curbed purchases amid shrinking margins, and as large state-owned plants underwent maintenance.  As most of the March arriving Russian shipments were contracted before the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, any cut to Russian oil purchases due to worries of sanctions would only be reflected in data due for release in May. Wednesday's data showed zero imports from Iran, after customs reported two rare shipments in December and January which sources said were meant for government emergency stockpiling.  According to tanker tracking data, China's imports of Iranian oil exceeded 700,000 bpd for January, surpassing the 623,000-bpd peak reached in 2017 before former U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions in 2018 on Iranian oil exports.  Wednesday's data did not show imports from Venezuela either, with state oil firms shunning imports since late 2019. Imports from Malaysia, however, often used as a transfer point in the past couple of years for oil originating from Iran and Venezuela, held stable versus a year earlier at 1.9 million tonnes. That was up from an average of 1.08 million tonnes during the January-February period.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-imports-13-less-crude-oil-saudi-march-14-less-russia-customs-2022-04-20/

Both said they were then held with around 40 other captives on the concrete floor of a nearby factory, their hands bound. Nearly a week later they were transferred in a military truck to Belarus, and on to detention centres in Russia, they said. Khropun, an electrical engineer, and Ivannikova-Katsemon, an emergency services dispatcher, were freed with 24 others in a prisoner exchange on April 9. Standing outside the dank windowless room where they say they were kept in the formerly occupied village of Dymer, north of the capital, Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon have returned to describe their three weeks in Russian custody, which they said included being beaten. Ivannikova-Katsemon also said she was tasered. Both said they were working as volunteers for the local Red Cross when they were taken prisoner, interrogated and accused of passing information on the activity of Russian forces to the other side, which they deny. The Ukrainian Red Cross confirmed they were both volunteers. They were both reported as missing or illegally detained civilians by the Euromaidan SOS initiative of Ukrainian human rights group The Center for Civil Liberties as of March 26. Reuters was not able to independently verify all the details of their stories. The Kremlin and Russia's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment about their accounts.

During a news conference in Detroit, forensic pathologist Werner Spitz and attorneys for the family of Patrick Lyoya said the autopsy found the 26-year-old was shot once and that the police officer held his gun to the back of Lyoya's head. ""That is now scientific evidence of this tragic killing where his family believes was an execution,"" civil rights attorney Ben Crump said during the news conference. Spitz said he found no signs of a struggle such as scratches or bruises on Lyoya's body, noting that the only injury was a bullet wound. He also said he did not know the caliber of bullet that was fired, but that it was a ""powerful bullet"" that killed the man. The death of Lyoya, a Congolese refugee, outraged members of his family and touched off protests in Grand Rapids by activists who say it represents the latest example of police violence against young Black men. Lyoya's family is demanding that authorities dismiss the officer who shot him from the force and file criminal charges against him.  Grand Rapids police were not immediately available to comment in response to the independent autopsy findings.

Speaking softly and slowly for nearly three hours, Depp said in a Virginia courtroom that it was a ""complete shock"" about six years ago when Heard ""made some quite heinous and disturbing"" allegations that he became violent during their relationship. ""Never did I myself reach the point of striking Ms. Heard in any way, nor have I ever struck any woman in my life,"" said Depp, who wore a dark suit with his hair in a ponytail. ""I felt it my responsibility to stand up not only for myself in that instance but stand up for my children,"" the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star said. His two children from a previous relationship were in high school at the time.

He filed a $50 million lawsuit against Heard in 2018.

2022-04-19,Reuters,"IMF sees UK growth slowing to weakest in G7 next year Britain faces slower economic growth and more persistent inflation than any other major economy next year, the International Monetary Fund forecast on Tuesday as part of a broader downgrade to global growth prospects. The IMF warned Russia's invasion of Ukraine was amplifying inflation pressures that were already present across Western economies, squeezing living standards and growth.  ""Consumption is projected to be weaker than expected as inflation erodes real disposable income, while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment,"" the IMF said about Britain. The IMF cut its forecast for British gross domestic product growth this year to 3.7% from January's forecast of 4.7%, while for 2023 the growth rate was almost halved to 1.2% from 2.3%. The projected growth for Britain next year is lower than for any other major advanced economy and below the 1.8% forecast last month from Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the downgrade reflected ""elevated inflation pressures"" and tighter monetary policy, while IMF Deputy Director Petya Koeva Brooks highlighted a ""major supply shock"" from higher energy prices. British inflation hit a 30-year high of 7.0% last month and the IMF forecasts it will average 7.4% this year -- slightly less than in the United States and higher than in the euro zone. Next year inflation is forecast to be much slower to ease than in any other major economy, averaging 5.3% compared with falls to 2.9% in the United States and 2.3% in the euro zone. Britain, like the United States, had also seen a drop in the number of older workers since the pandemic, creating labour shortages, the IMF added. As part of general advice to central banks, the IMF said they should communicate clearly what they think is a 'neutral' interest rate, as well as their willingness if needed to keep rates above that level to bring down inflation.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/imf-sees-uk-growth-slowing-weakest-g7-next-year-2022-04-19/

Brent crude , the global benchmark, fell $5.91, or 5.22%, to settle at $107.25 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate dropped $5.65, or 5.22%, to settle at $102.56 a barrel. Prices declined despite lower output from OPEC+, which produced 1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) below its targets in March, as Russian output began to decrease following sanctions imposed by the West over its invasion of Ukraine, according to a report from the producer alliance seen by Reuters.  Russia produced about 300,000 bpd below its target in March at 10.018 million bpd, based on secondary sources, the report showed. OPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies led by Russia, agreed last month to a monthly oil output boost of 432,000 bpd for May, resisting pressure by major consumers to pump more.  The IMF lowered its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, citing Russia's invasion, and said that inflation is now a ""clear and present danger"" for many countries.  The bearish outlook added to price pressure from the dollar trading at a two-year high. A firmer greenback makes commodities priced in dollars more expensive for holders of other currencies, which can dampen demand. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Tuesday said the Fed could raise its policy target range to 2.25% to 2.5% by year-end, but if inflation remains high will likely need to hike rates further. Meanwhile, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Monday that U.S. inflation is ""far too high"" as he repeated his case for increasing interest rates to 3.5% by the end of the year to slow what are now 40-year-high inflation readings.

On Monday, Canada's Citizen Lab group said that in the wake of a failed independence bid in 2017, more than 60 people linked to the Catalan separatist movement, including current leader Pere Aragones and several of his predecessors, had been targets of ""Pegasus"" spyware made by Israel's NSO Group.  ""A democratic state does not spy on its citizens...a democratic state does not listen in on the private conversations of its political opponents,"" Aragones told a news conference.

North Macedonia, once a frontrunner in attracting renewable energy investors, said earlier this month it planned to open two new coal mines to supply power stations. The energy ministry also said it wants to buy 3 million tonnes of coal from neighbouring Kosovo, though no deal has been signed. ""With the start of the energy crisis, not just us but all nations in Europe have immediately increased the production of electricity from coal because it is the cheapest and most secure (source),"" said Vasko Kovacevski, CEO of state-owned power utility Elektrani na Severna Makedonija (ESM).

Scholz is facing growing frustration at home as well as abroad with what critics say is his lack of leadership on Ukraine. Even members of the junior partners in his three-way coalition are now openly accusing him of dithering on Ukrainian pleas to send it more heavy weapons. Speaking after participating in a call with Western allies including U.S. President Joe Biden, Scholz said they were coordinating more weapons deliveries to Ukraine to ensure it could fend off Russia's invasion. Asked however if Germany would send Leopard tanks, he said the Western allies - not just Berlin - agreed it made sense to send Ukraine arms it could immediately deploy. As such, the allies would enable East European countries to hand over Soviet weapons it was familiar with by committing to replacing them, he said. Moreover Berlin was liaising between German military equipment makers and Ukraine to deliver the country weapons like anti-tank and air defence weapons.

In response to last month's vote, 46 European crypto industry leaders and organisations said in their letter that the proposals ""will put every digital asset owner at risk"" by leading to public disclosure of transaction details and wallet addresses. This would reduce crypto holders' privacy and safety, the letter's organisers said. The EU is also introducing a wider framework, known as MiCA, to regulate all issuers and service providers in the EU dealing with crypto assets. The European Parliament recently approved its draft of the regulation, which will be negotiated with the EU's executive branch and heads of member states. The letter asked that the EU excludes decentralised projects, which includes decentralised finance or ""DeFi"", from requirements to register as legal entities. It also said that certain decentralised ""stablecoins"" should not be subject to the MiCA regulation. Britain has said it will regulate stablecoins, as part of plans to create a global cryptoasset hub.  CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti, who organised the letter, said that Europe currently had more complex crypto regulations than other regions, which deterred businesses from growing in Europe.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-crypto-industry-steps-up-efforts-influence-eu-policy-2022-04-19/
2022-04-18,Reuters,"World Bank says war to cut global growth, boosts financing target The World Bank is reducing its global growth forecast for 2022 by nearly a full percentage point, to 3.2% from 4.1%, due to the impacts from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, World Bank President David Malpass said on Monday. Malpass told reporters on a conference call that the World Bank was responding to the added economic stresses from the war by proposing a new, 15-month crisis financing target of $170 billion, with a goal to commit about $50 billion of this financing over the next three months. Malpass said the biggest component of the bank's growth forecast reduction was a 4.1% contraction in the Europe and Central Asia region -- comprising Ukraine, Russia and surrounding countries  The International Monetary Fund is expected to cut its global growth forecast on Tuesday. ""We're preparing for a continued crisis response, given the multiple crises,"" Malpass said. ""Over the next few weeks, I expect to discuss with our board, a new 15-month crisis response envelope of around $170 billion to cover April 2022 through June 2023."" The plan follows on from a World Bank $160 billion COVID-19 financing program, of which Malpass said $157 billion was committed through June 2021. Malpass said the financing partly will support countries that have taken in refugees from Ukraine and will also help address problems in countries affected by food shortages. Malpass said World Bank and IMF member countries this week will be discussing new assistance for Ukraine, and expects specific commitments to be announced by a number of donor countries.

2022-04-18,Reuters,"Turkey says its warplanes hit Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq Turkish warplanes, helicopters and drones hit Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq in an air and land operation that targeted facilities ranging from camps to ammunition stores, Turkey's defence ministry said on Monday. The military action was part of a long-running Turkish campaign in Iraq and Syria against militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, both regarded as terrorist groups by Ankara. The operation focused on the Iraqi regions of Metina, Zap, and Avasin-Basyan, the ministry said in a statement. Alongside the air operation, commandos and special forces also participated, both by land and air. ""Our operation is continuing successfully as planned,"" the state-owned Anadolu news agency quoted Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying. ""The targets identified in the first phase have been captured."" No information on casualties was given. The action, called ""Operation Claw Lock"", aimed to ""prevent terror attacks"" and ensure border security following an assessment that the PKK was planning a large-scale attack, the ministry added. Artillery also fired on militant targets in the military action, it said. Turkey regularly launches air strikes into northern Iraq, a region into which it has repeatedly sent commandos, to support its offensives. The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which in the past was mainly focused in southeast Turkey.

Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. So far, four flights of weapons have been sent by the United States as part of the new package. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the howitzer training would take place outside Ukraine. The United States is planning on teaching Ukrainian trainers on how to use some of the new batch of weapons such as howitzers and radars and then for the trainers to instruct their colleagues inside Ukraine. The United States has previously trained Ukrainian forces on Switchblade drones.

2022-04-18,Reuters,"Russian teacher rejected Kremlin propaganda, then paid the price Days after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Andrei Shestakov opened a set of files in a WhatsApp group chat for history teachers like himself in his town in east Russia. The files - which Reuters reviewed and contain dozens of pages of documents and presentations as well as video links - are instructions on how to teach teenage school children about the conflict. It’s unclear who shared the files to the group chat, but many of the documents carry the crest of the education ministry in Moscow. The material includes lesson guides stating that Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine were heroes, that Ukraine's rulers made common cause with people who collaborated with World War Two Nazis, that the West was trying to spread discord in Russian society, and that Russians must stick together. Shestakov said he leafed through the files during one of his lessons. The slim-built 38-year-old said that before becoming a teacher in January he had spent 16 years as a police officer. But he had growing doubts in recent years, he said, about whether Russia's rulers were living up to the values they professed about democracy, influenced in part by prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. He decided not to teach the modules to his pupils at the Gymnasium No. 2 school where he worked in Neryungri, a coal-mining town in eastern Siberia, some 6,700 km (4160 miles) east of Moscow. Instead, Shestakov told his pupils about the contents of the teaching guide and why they were historically inaccurate, he told Reuters. For instance, he said he explained that the materials claimed Ukraine was an invention of Bolshevik communist Russia yet history textbooks discussed Ukrainian history going back centuries. He went further. On March 1, he told pupils during a civics class he would not advise them to serve in the Russian army, that he opposed the war against Ukraine, and that Russia's leaders exhibited elements of fascism even while saying they were fighting fascism in Ukraine, according to a signed statement taken by police and reviewed by Reuters. In the following days, the local police and the Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, summoned Shestakov for questioning, according to the March 5 signed statement about his classroom comments. He said he has not been charged in relation to those comments. The FSB and local police didn’t respond to requests for comment. A court did fine him 35,000 roubles (about $420) on March 18 for discrediting the Russian armed forces after he re-posted videos online of interviews with Russian soldiers captured in Ukraine, according to a court ruling seen by Reuters. He said he quit his job last month because he believed he would be fired anyway for his public opposition to the war, he told Reuters. The local education authority and the education ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment on Shestakov and the teaching guide. When Reuters reached the school by phone, a woman who identified herself as acting head teacher said she declined to comment on Shestakov’s case and ended the call.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-teacher-rejected-kremlin-propaganda-then-paid-price-2022-04-18/
2022-04-18,Reuters,"Shanghai factories sputter towards reopening as city aims to ease lockdown Manufacturers including Tesla (TSLA.O) began preparing on Monday to reopen their Shanghai plants as China’s most populous city speeds up efforts to get back to normal after a nearly three-week COVID shutdown. Still, most workers will have to live onsite, and there was no immediate word how factories will deal with disrupted supply lines and access to market, with closures ordered by authorities in other cities and port and trucking problems. The shutdown in the city and China's measures to control the pandemic elsewhere have hurt the economy and rattled global supply chains. Shanghai's 25 million people have struggled with income losses, lack of steady food supplies, separation of families and poor conditions in quarantine centres. Beijing said last week it had drawn up a ""white list"" of 666 firms prioritised to reopen or keep Shanghai operations going. These include Tesla, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its Chinese partner SAIC Motor (600104.SS), as well as semiconductor and medical firms, according to a copy of the list seen by Reuters. To prepare for the restart, Tesla has recalled workers to its Shanghai plant where they will need to live on site, in line with China's ""closed loop management"" process, two sources said. SAIC Motor (600104.SS) said it would start conducting stress tests on Monday on its own production resumption plans, while Volkswagen said it was evaluating the feasibility of resuming production at its joint venture with SAIC.  The city aims to stop spread of COVID-19 outside quarantined areas by Wednesday, Reuters cited sources as saying on Sunday, an ambitious target that would allow further easing of its lockdown. It is stepping up testing and the transfer of positive cases and their close contacts to isolation centres to meet that goal.  Shanghai's lockdown and wider China curbs are taking a toll on the world's No.2 economy during a key year for President Xi Jinping, who is expected to secure a third leadership term in the autumn. Data for March released on Monday showed that consumption and employment suffered because of COVID curbs, with economists predicting a worsening overall economic outlook.

The Citizen Lab digital rights group found more than 60 people linked to the Catalan separatist movement, including several members of the European Parliament, other politicians, lawyers and activists, had been targeted with ""Pegasus"" spyware made by Israel's NSO Group after a failed independence bid. NSO said the information about the allegations was false. ""It's an unjustifiable disgrace,"" Catalan leader Pere Aragones tweeted. ""An extremely serious attack on fundamental rights and democracy."" Describing the use of surveillance software as crossing a ""red line"", he demanded explanations from the Spanish government.

NSO, which markets the software as a law-enforcement tool, said Citizen Lab and Amnesty International, which was not involved in this investigation but has published previous studies about Pegasus, had produced inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports to target the company.

No Gaza faction claimed responsibility for the launch, which followed warnings by the dominant Hamas Islamists of reprisals for Israeli conduct around Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound. Within hours, Israeli air strikes hit camps used by Hamas and another Gaza faction, Palestinian sources said. The military said one target was an arms manufacturing site. No one was hurt. Since Friday, Al Aqsa - also revered by Jews as a vestige of two ancient temples - has seen confrontations between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli riot police recalling violence that helped fan a Gaza war one year ago.  Palestinians accuse Israel of encroaching at Al Aqsa during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel says Palestinian protesters seek to disrupt Muslim prayer for political ends and to prevent visits by Jews, who are now celebrating Passover. The tensions complicate Israel's security ties with Jordan, which is custodian of Al Aqsa and has a Palestinian majority. Jordan's King Abdullah told U.N.

The meeting comes at a time when Biden's administration is grappling with rising numbers of migrants attempting to cross the U.S. border from Mexico, with Cubans making up a growing portion of them. Tensions between Washington and Havana over the Cuban government's crackdown on protests, continuing American sanctions on the Communist-ruled island and other issues have made it difficult for the countries to cooperate on challenges such as irregular migration. Leading the Cuban delegation will be Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The delegation is expected to meet with senior officials of the U.S. State Department and other agencies. The United States wants Cuba to take back more deportees from among the record numbers of Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexican border, according to a U.S. official and another source, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Cuba has said it supports legal, orderly and safe migration. It blames the United States for the uptick in irregular migration, saying Cold War-era sanctions and a decision to close the American consular section in Havana encourage Cubans to seek riskier routes off the island.

The South American country's public utility infrastructure has been deteriorating for more than a decade, but worsened in 2019 when there were three major national black-outs.

2022-04-18,Reuters,"Russia flags further rate cut, more budget spending Russia on Monday flagged a likely further cut in interest rates and more budget spending to help the economy adapt to biting western sanctions as it heads for its deepest contraction since 1994. Russia faces soaring inflation and capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the West imposed unprecedented sanctions to punish President Vladimir Putin for sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin said on Monday that Russia should use its state budget to support the economy and liquidity when lending activity has waned. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink by more than 11% this year.  The central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% on Feb. 28 as the first wave of sanctions hit, before trimming it to 17% on April 8. It is expected to lower it further at the next board meeting on April 29. ""We must have the possibility to lower the key rate faster,"" Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Monday. ""We must create conditions to increase the availability of credit for the economy."" Although inflation in Russia has accelerated to its highest since early 2002, the central bank ""will not try to lower it by any means - this would prevent business from adapting,"" Nabiullina said. The current inflation spike is caused by low supply, not high demand, and the central bank aims to bring it to its 4% target in 2024 as the economy adapts to western sanctions, she said, speaking at the lower house of parliament. ""The period when the economy can live on reserves is finite. And already in the second and third quarter we will enter a period of structural transformation and the search for new business models,"" Nabiullina said. She also said Moscow planned to take legal action over the blocking of gold, forex and assets belonging to Russian residents, while adding that such a step would need to be painstakingly thought through. Foreign sanctions have frozen about $300 billion of the roughly $640 billion that Russia had in its gold and forex reserves when it launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/russia-faces-economic-upheaval-two-years-return-inflation-target-nabiullina-2022-04-18/

Las Bambas accounts for 2% of the global copper supply and is a subject of recurring disruptions from impoverished local communities demanding higher financial contributions from the mine. Earlier this year, the mine were forced to slow down operations due to a road blockade. MMG said the Fuerabamba community's members had entered Las Bambas on April 14 to protest the company's alleged failure to comply with its social investment commitments, allegations which MMG rejects. Members of the Huancuire community had also joined the protests. The minerals exploration company also said a meeting was conducted on April 16, which included Peru's Minister of Mines and Energy, members of the Fuerabamba community and Las Bambas, but the parties could not arrive at a resolution. Further meetings led by the Prime Minister's Office are scheduled over the coming days, MMG said. Reuters could not reach a representative of the Fuerabamba community for comment. Fuerabamba is an indigenous quechua-speaking community that was resettled a few years ago to make way for Las Bambas in Peru's Apurimac region. Las Bambas is a member of the SNMPE, which represents the country's large mines, and Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer. MMG said Las Bambas will be unable to continue copper production from April 20, clarifying a statement made earlier in the day by Raul Jacob, the president of local mining chamber SNMPE, that operations had already ceased. ""Last week, 130 people from the Fuerabamba community invaded Las Bambas,"" Jacob had told reporters earlier in the day. ""This invasion has caused the suspension of operations.""

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, will stay on despite demands from protesters and the opposition for them to quit. Rajapaksa has governed the South Asian island nation since 2019 with other family members in top government positions. The island nation of 22 million is experiencing prolonged power cuts and fuel and medicines shortages triggered by a tumble in its foreign exchange reserves that has stalled imports of essentials, leading to daily protests in the commercial capital Colombo.

The idea of the metaverse involves people moving freely between virtual worlds on different platforms and taking their virtual clothing and other belongings with them, a concept called interoperability. Such an idea is many years away and will require collaboration between companies and metaverse developers, including Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Epic Games.  FlickPlay is an app where players can unlock digital collectibles by using an interactive map of their actual surroundings, and then use their phone's camera to overlay the collectibles onto the real world and interact with the objects to make videos and other content. On Monday, the app announced its first collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) called Flicky, which will feature designs of an anthropomorphic chameleon wearing different clothes.  A portion of people who acquire a Flicky will be able to use the NFT as their avatar on The Sandbox, a web and mobile game where players can build a three-dimensional virtual world. Initially, Flicky owners will unlock a version of the chameleon to use on The Sandbox, but soon they will be able to use the exact version of the digital asset that is stored on the blockchain in both games, said Pierina Merino, founder and chief executive of FlickPlay, adding that the company is working with The Sandbox to reach interoperability by the end of the year. The integration is notable because it may be the first to bridge an NFT in the virtual world with usage linked to the physical world, said Sebastien Borget, co-founder of The Sandbox.

Adding to supply pressures from sanctions on Russia, Libya's National Oil Corp on Monday said ""a painful wave of closures"" had begun hitting its facilities and declared force majeure at Al-Sharara oilfield and other sites. ""With global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,"" said Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA. Brent crude , the global benchmark, rose $1.46, or 1.3%, to settle at $113.16 a barrel. The contract rose to $114.84 a barrel, its highest since March 28. U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose $1.26, or 1.2%, to settle at $108.21 a barrel. The benchmark hit $109.81 a barrel, also the highest since March 28. Deeper supply losses loom.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Board saw core inflation lifting above the bank's 2-3% target range in the March quarter and more firms were expecting to pass on price rises to consumers. Wage growth was still lagging but likely to pick up as the unemployment rate fell to 4% and below. ""These developments have brought forward the likely timing of the first increase in interest rates,"" the minutes showed. ""Over coming months, important additional evidence will be available on both inflation and the evolution of labour costs."" Data for consumer prices are due on April 26 and analysts suspect it will show core inflation jumped by 1.0% or more in the first quarter to lift the annual pace to at least 3.2%. That would be the first time core inflation topped the RBA's 2-3% target band since early 2010, making it harder to justify retaining rates at emergency lows of 0.1%. Key figures on wages for the March quarter are out on May 18, while data on gross domestic product on June 1 would provide broader evidence on labour costs. ""While the Q1 wage index will still show subdued wage growth, we think that will be trumped by rapidly rising inflation and we're sticking to our long-held forecast that the Bank will start its tightening cycle in June,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics. Markets, too, are wagering heavily on a rate rise to 0.25% at the RBA's June 7 policy meeting , and have almost seven more hikes to near 2.0% implied by year end. That aggressive outlook in part reflects expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike by 50 basis points in both May and June, adding to pressure for other central banks to follow.

The March study of 2,100 people, conducted on Java, home to 150 million people, and Bali, Indonesia's top tourism destination, revealed 99.2% of people had COVID antibodies, a 6 percentage point increase from a December survey. Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, which conducted the survey with the health ministry, on Monday told Reuters the antibody levels in the latest survey were higher due to a wider booster shot rollout, as recipients had stronger protection. Indonesia's daily case numbers have decreased significantly since a spike in February driven by the Omicron variant. About 60% of its 270 million people have been vaccinated against COVID. Pandu said the stronger antibodies may explain the faster rate at which Omicron variant infections declined in Indonesia. The December study, of 22,000 people, was conducted nationwide and showed 86% of Indonesians had antibodies.

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Omicron infection induces limited immune response Unvaccinated people infected with the Omicron variant are unlikely to develop immune responses that will protect them against other variants of the coronavirus, a new study suggests. Unlike antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines or infections with earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, antibodies induced by the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants do not neutralize other versions of the virus, researchers found when they analyzed blood samples obtained after Omicron infection. People with Omicron ""breakthrough"" infections after three doses of the mRNA vaccines designed to neutralize earlier versions of the virus had high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the two Omicron variants, although the efficiency was lower than against previous SARS-CoV-2 versions, according to a report undergoing peer review at Nature Portfolio and posted on Research Square. But among those whose immune systems had not been primed to recognize the virus through vaccination or by natural infection, antibodies after Omicron infection ""were very specific for the respective Omicron variant, and we detected almost no neutralizing antibodies targeting non-Omicron virus strains,"" said Karin Stiasny and Judity Aberle of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria in a joint email. BA.2-induced antibodies appeared to be particularly unlikely to defend against any other variant, they added. The study ""emphasizes the importance of booster vaccinations for immune protection."" COVID-19 hospital death rates go up on weekends The average number of global deaths from COVID-19 were 6% higher on weekends compared to weekdays throughout the pandemic, according to statistics reported to the World Health Organization between March 2020 and March 2022. The research, scheduled for presentation this month at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, found that worldwide there were on average 449 more COVID deaths on weekends than weekdays (8,532 vs 8,083). The highest absolute increase in weekend COVID-19 deaths was in the United States (average 1,483 weekend deaths vs 1,220 weekday deaths), followed by Brazil (1,061 vs 823), the UK (239 vs 215) and Canada (56 v 48 deaths). Only Germany reported significantly fewer average deaths at weekends compared to weekdays. The increase in COVID-19 deaths on weekends may reflect reporting delays, but it also is likely due to hospital staffing levels and other organizational factors, the researchers said in a statement. The data does not take into account patients' individual risk factors, local policies and public health interventions, which could have affected the outcomes. ""Further studies, with detailed clinical data are needed to investigate the drivers of and causes for the risk of death on weekdays and weekends from COVID-19,"" the researchers said in the statement.

Investigative website Mediapart wrote on Saturday that the OLAF report claimed Le Pen had misappropriated 140,000 euros of public money with party members in total diverting 617,000 euros. None are accused of profiting directly, but of claiming EU funds for staff and event expenses. Le Pen's office could not immediately be reached for comment. ""The French will not be fooled by attempts of the European Union and the European institutions (...) to interfere in the presidential campaign and harm Marine Le Pen,"" National Rally president Jordan Bardella told Europe 1 radio. He said his party had filed two legal complaints against OLAF, and that it would be filing a third in response to the report. Speaking to BFM TV, Le Pen's lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut said his client denied the charges. He said she had yet to be questioned and neither he nor Le Pen had seen the OLAF report. Le Pen has been under investigation since 2017 as part of a probe into the alleged misuse of European Union funds to pay parliamentary assistants.

2022-04-17,Reuters,"Shanghai targets lockdown turning point by Wednesday Shanghai has set a target to stop the spread of COVID-19 outside of quarantined areas by Wednesday, two people familiar with the matter said, which would allow the city to further ease its lockdown and start returning to normal life as public frustrations grow. The target will require officials to accelerate COVID testing and the transfer of positive cases to quarantine centres, according to a speech by a local Communist Party official dated Saturday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Ending community-level transmission has been a turning point for other Chinese localities that locked down, such as Shenzhen city which last month reopened public transport and let businesses go back to work shortly after achieving that target. Shanghai has become the epicentre of China's largest outbreak since the virus was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019, and has recorded more than 320,000 COVID infections since early March when its surge began. Frustrated Shanghai residents have taken to social media to vent their anger at local authorities over difficulties sourcing food, lost income, separated families and poor conditions at central quarantine centres. Tensions have on occasion erupted into public protests or scuffles with police.  The Chinese economy and global supply chains are also feeling pinched by shuttered factories and transport bottlenecks in many parts of China hit by COVID-19 curbs.  Shanghai has already taken piecemeal steps to ease restrictions. State TV reported on Sunday that some supermarkets had reopened their doors to shoppers, although many residents expressed disbelief in social media postings. A Shanghai government-backed social media account said it was in one district in the outskirts. Shanghai's new target of ""zero-COVID at the community level"" by April 20 was communicated in recent days to the city's Communist Party cadres and organisations such as schools, according to the sources, who declined to be named as the information was not public. China's definition of zero-COVID status at the community level means that no new cases emerge outside quarantined areas. A speech dated Saturday by the party secretary of the city's Baoshan district described it as an order that had come as the city's situation reached a ""critical moment"", with growing public anxiety and food supply pressures.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/shanghai-targets-lockdown-turning-point-by-wednesday-sources-2022-04-17/

The floods have left thousands homeless, knocked out power and water services and disrupted operations at one of Africa's busiest ports, Durban. A provincial economic official estimated the overall infrastructure damage at more than 10 billion rand ($684.6 million). The province's premier, Sihle Zikalala, said the death toll had risen to 443, with a further 63 people unaccounted for. In some of the worst-affected areas, residents said they were terrified by the thought of more rain, which was forecast to fall on Sunday. Some faced an agonising wait for news of missing loved ones. ""We haven't lost hope.

2022-04-17,Reuters,"On 'Easter of war', pope implicitly criticises Russia over Ukraine Pope Francis implicitly criticised Russia for dragging Ukraine into a ""cruel and senseless"" conflict and urged leaders to strive for peace as he marked what he called an ""Easter of war"" on Sunday. The 85-year-old pope made the comments in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) address - traditionally an overview of world conflicts - to about 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square. It was the first Easter since 2019 that the public was allowed into the square to hear the twice-yearly address following two years of COVID-19 restrictions. Francis dedicated much of the message to Ukraine, comparing the shock of another war in Europe to the shock of the apostles when the gospel says they saw the risen Jesus. ""Our eyes, too, are incredulous on this Easter of war. We have seen all too much blood, all too much violence. Our hearts, too, have been filled with fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing,"" he said. ""May there be peace for war-torn Ukraine, so sorely tried by the violence and destruction of the cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged,"" he said. Moscow describes the action it launched on Feb. 24 as a ""special military operation"". Francis, who did not mention Russia by name, has already rejected that terminology, calling it a war and previously using terms such as unjustified aggression and invasion. ""Let there be a decision for peace. May there be an end to the flexing of muscles while people are suffering,"" Francis said on Sunday, going on to thank those who had taken in refugees from Ukraine, most of whom have gone to Poland. Earlier this month in Malta, Francis implicitly criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion, saying a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflict for nationalist interests.

2022-04-17,Reuters,"Explainer: Sri Lanka's reluctance to tap IMF helped push it into an economic abyss Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis has triggered an unprecedented wave of spontaneous protests as the island nation of 22 million people struggles with prolonged power cuts and a shortage of essentials, including fuel and medicines. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government has come under growing pressure for its mishandling of the economy, and the country has suspended foreign debt payments in an effort to preserve its paltry foreign exchange reserves.  On Monday, Sri Lanka will begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme, even as it seeks help from other countries, including neighbouring India, and China. Economic mismanagement by successive governments weakened Sri Lanka's public finances, leaving its national expenditure in excess of its income, and the production of tradable goods and services at an inadequate level.  The situation was exacerbated by deep tax cuts enacted by the Rajapaksa government soon after it took office in 2019, which came just months before the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic wiped out parts of its economy - mainly the lucrative tourism industry - while an inflexible foreign exchange rate sapped remittances from its foreign workers. Rating agencies, concerned about government finances and its inability to repay large foreign debt, downgraded Sri Lanka's credit ratings from 2020 onwards, eventually locking the country out of international financial markets. But to keep its economy afloat, the government still leaned heavily on its foreign exchange reserves, eroding them by more than 70% in two years. By March, Sri Lanka's reserves stood at only $1.93 billion, insufficient to even cover a month of imports, and leading to spiralling shortages of everything from diesel to some food items. J.P. Morgan analysts estimate the country's gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with the current account deficit coming in around $3 billion.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sri-lankas-reluctance-tap-imf-helped-push-it-into-an-economic-abyss-2022-04-18/

The incident has increased already simmering tensions between the neighbours. Taliban authorities on Saturday summoned Pakistan's ambassador in Kabul on Saturday to protest against the strikes.

Erdogan's comments come amid efforts by Turkey and Israel in recent weeks to normalise their long-strained ties, as part of a regional charm offensive launched by Ankara in 2020. On Friday, at least 152 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli riot police inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the latest outbreak in an upsurge of violence that has raised fears of a slide back to wider conflict.  Most of the Palestinian injuries were incurred from rubber bullets, stun grenades and beatings with police batons, the Palestine Red Crescent said.

2022-04-17,Reuters,"Mexican president's contentious electricity overhaul defeated in Congress Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's plan to increase state control of power generation was defeated in parliament on Sunday, as opposition parties united in the face of a bill they said would hurt investment and breach international obligations. His National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and its allies fell nearly 60 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed in the 500-seat lower house of Congress, mustering just 275 votes after a raucous session that lasted more than 12 hours. Seeking to roll back previous constitutional reforms that liberalized the electricity market, Lopez Obrador's proposed changes would have done away with a requirement that state-owned Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) sell the cheapest electricity first, allowing it to sell its own electricity ahead of other power companies. Under the bill, the CFE would also have been set to generate a minimum of 54% of the country's total electricity, and energy regulation would have been shifted from independent bodies to state regulators. The contentious proposals faced much criticism from business groups and the United States, Mexico's top trade partner as well as other allies who argued it would violate the regional trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Lopez Obrador had argued the bill would have protected consumers and made the country more energy independent, saying the legislation was vital to his plans to ""transform"" Mexico. Although the odds were against his party, he came into the vote seeking to leverage his victory in last weekend's referendum on his leadership. Speaking ahead of the vote, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, a lawmaker from the opposition Citizens' Movement party, said the proposals, if enacted, would damage Mexico. ""There isn't a specialist, academic, environmentalist or activist with a smidgen of doubt - this bill would increase electricity prices, slow the transition to (clean) energy in our country and violate international agreements,"" he added.

Israel, widely believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal, says it will not be bound by any Iran nuclear deal and could eventually take unilateral action against Iranian nuclear sites.

Ahead of the May 21 poll, Labor sees its protection of Australia’s cherished universal healthcare scheme as a key differentiator between it and the governing Liberal National coalition, which bills itself as superior on economic management and border protection. Labor seized on Medicare as a key issue after Morrison said on Sunday that he would appoint Anne Ruston as health minister if he is returned to office. Ruston several years ago described Medicare as unsustainable. “This is a health minister, now designate if they're successful in the election, who we know will undermine Medicare, who has said that the current model is not sustainable,” Labor opposition leader Anthony Albanese told reporters in Brisbane. Campaigning in Perth to announce investment in two new navy patrol boats, Morrison insisted that there would be no cuts to Medicare if his government were re-elected. “She (Anne Ruston) said yesterday there would not be any cuts and I would repeat that today,” he told reporters. Morrison turned attention to asylum seeker policy, saying the new patrol boats would play an ""ongoing and important role"" in Australia 's border protection capabilities, while also criticising Labor for its past approach on the issue. ""When Labor abolished temporary protection visas in 2008, the armada of people smugglers' boats came to Australia and that was the launching point, and I note that people smugglers are very aware of my resolve,"" Morrison said. The comments come after Albanese, earlier in the campaign, was forced to clarify Labor's stance on border protection after mistakenly saying that it aligned with that of government.

The ministerial code sets out the standards of conduct expected of ministers and how they discharge their duties, according to the government website. Johnson has been accused of misleading parliament over the matter by opposition lawmakers after he told parliament last year that all rules were followed in Downing Street during the pandemic.

However, margins have come under pressure as the rise in demand led to higher attrition, wage hikes to retain talent, and higher sub-contract costs. Infosys' operating margin fell 3% year-on-year to 21.5% in the March quarter, while voluntary attrition at the IT services business surged to 27.7% in the last 12 months from 10.9% a year ago.

2022-04-17,Reuters,"Broad says he's not keen to take over from Root as England test captain England bowler Stuart Broad said he was not thinking about replacing Joe Root as the test captain, while adding that he felt no ""bitterness"" towards Root after being dropped from the squad for their recent tour of the Caribbean. Root ended his five-year tenure on Friday, saying the job had taken a heavy toll on him recently.  The 35-year-old Broad has been touted as a short-term option to replace him, while former England captains have backed all-rounder Ben Stokes for the role.  Broad, England's second-highest wicket-taker in tests behind James Anderson, said he was focused on returning to the England squad after being dropped for the West Indies tour, which they lost 1-0. ""I am aware that my name has been touted as a potential successor to Joe as England captain and I guess that is because I am an experienced centrally contracted player who has been around the international game a long time,"" Broad wrote in his Mail On Sunday column. ""However, it is not something I have given any thought to because firstly I am not currently in possession of a shirt within the England test team and my focus is very much on changing that by taking wickets for Nottinghamshire over the next few weeks."" ""I would argue we are in a fairly unique position as far as selection for the test team goes right now in that there are only two players whose names you could write in pen on the scorecard. One of them is Joe Root, the other is Ben Stokes."" Broad said he was frustrated by his recent omission, but that it did not affect his relationship with Root. ""People may question my relationship with Joe given recent history but I've always been good at differentiating between friendship and business,"" Broad added.

Rinat Akhmetov has seen his business empire shattered by eight years of fighting in Ukraine's east but remains defiant, sure that what he calls ""our brave soldiers"" will defend the Sea of Azov city reduced to a wasteland by seven weeks of bombardment. For now, though, his Metinvest company, Ukraine's biggest steelmaker, has announced it cannot deliver its supply contracts and while his financial and industrial SCM Group is servicing its debt obligations, his private power producer DTEK ""has optimised payment of its debts"" in an agreement with creditors. ""Mariupol is a global tragedy and a global example of heroism. For me, Mariupol has been and will always be a Ukrainian city,"" Akhmetov said in written answers to questions from Reuters. ""I believe that our brave soldiers will defend the city, though I understand how difficult and hard it is for them,"" he said, adding he was in daily contact with the Metinvest managers who run the Azovstal and Illich Iron and Steel Works plants in Mariupol. On Friday, Metinvest said it would never operate under Russian occupation and that the Mariupol siege had disabled more than a third of Ukraine's metallurgy production capacity.  Akhmetov praised President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's ""passion and professionalism"" during the war, seemingly smoothing relations after the Ukrainian leader last year said plotters hoping to overthrow his government had tried to involve the businessman. Akhmetov called the allegation ""an absolute lie"" at the time. ""And the war is certainly not the time to be at odds...

Moscow's claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion. ""The situation is very difficult"" in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked.

A senior Russian officer was quoted as saying the offer, made after weeks of fierce fighting, was prompted by ""the catastrophic situation"" in the steelworks as well as ""purely humane principles"".  There was no immediate response from Kyiv.  As Moscow launched long-range missile attacks across the country following the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, Moscow said its warplanes had struck a tank repair factory in Kyiv on Saturday. An explosion was heard and smoke rose over the southeastern Darnytskyi district. The mayor said at least one person was killed and medics were fighting to save others.  The Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences.

The Zhengzhou Airport Economic Zone, a central Chinese manufacturing area that includes Apple Inc supplier Foxconn, announced a 14-day lockdown on Friday ""to be adjusted according to the epidemic situation"". In northwestern China, the city of Xian on Friday urged residents to avoid unnecessary trips outside their residential compounds and encouraged companies to have employees work from home or live at their workplace, following dozens of COVID-19 infections this month.  A Xian government official, responding to residents' concerns over potential food shortages, said on Saturday that the announcement did not constitute a lockdown and that the city would not impose one. The city of Suzhou, near Shanghai, said on Saturday that all employees capable of working from home must do so, and residential compounds and company campuses should avoid unnecessary entry of people and vehicles. It has reported more than 500 infections in its latest outbreak. Shanghai itself, which is at the centre of China's recent COVID surge starting in early March, on Saturday reported a record 3,590 symptomatic cases for April 15, as well as 19,923 asymptomatic cases. The asymptomatic case number was up slightly from 19,872 cases a day earlier. The city's case tally makes up the vast majority of cases nationwide even as most of its 25 million residents remain under lockdown.

Wong was chosen as leader of the ruling People's Action Party's (PAP) so-called fourth generation team, according to an announcement on Thursday, paving the way for him to become prime minister.  ""The plan is for Lawrence to succeed me as PM, either before or after (if the PAP wins) the next General Election. It is due in 2025 and will surely be a tough fight,"" Lee said in a social media post on Saturday. Lee, whose father Lee Kwan Yew was the island nation's independence leader, has been prime minister since 2004.

Wong, 49, who helped steer the Southeast Asian city-state through the COVID-19 pandemic as co-chair of the government's taskforce, had been tipped by analysts as a potential successor to Lee, 70. Leadership succession in the country, governed by the PAP since its 1965 independence, is normally a carefully planned affair. But an unexpected decision last year by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat to step aside as Lee's designated successor disrupted leadership planning. ""I am already 70 and I am looking forward to handing over to Lawrence once he is ready,"" Lee told a news conference.

The report comes amid signs North Korea could soon resume nuclear testing according to South Korean and U.S. officials and after Kim broke a self-imposed moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing with a launch last month. South Korea's military said on Sunday it had detected two projectiles launched on Saturday from the North's east coast towards the sea. The projectiles flew about 110 km (70 miles) with an apogee of 25 km and maximum speed of less than Mach 4, indicating they were short-range missiles. The KCNA report gave no details on the launch but linked it to the North's nuclear objectives. ""The new-type tactical guided weapon system ... is of great significance in drastically improving the firepower of the frontline long-range artillery units and enhancing the efficiency in the operation of tactical nukes,"" KCNA said. It said Kim ""gave important instructions on further building up the defence capabilities and nuclear combat forces of the country."" North Korea has been developing short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) that analysts say are designed to evade missile defences and strike targets in the South. On April 5, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim, said North Korea opposes war but would use nuclear weapons to strike South Korea if attacked, in a warning seen aimed at the South's incoming conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol. Yoon spokesperson Bae Hyun-jin said there was nothing new or surprising in the North's ""show of force"" as a new administration comes in.

Speaking to Reuters, he denied Nepal was facing an economic crisis despite the impact of soaring commodity prices as the tourist industry, a key source of revenues, struggles to recover after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nepal, wedged between China and India, this month imposed curbs on luxury goods imports to rein in capital outflows. Foreign exchange reserves fell over 18% to $9.6 billion as of mid-March from mid-July - enough for around six months imports. By depositing their savings in Nepal, overseas Nepalis would continue to ""maintain their link as well as benefit from 6 to 7% interest"" offered by Nepali banks, Sharma said. Sharma said the economy did not face a crisis and Nepal's situation could not be compared with Sri Lanka. That South Asian country is facing its worst economic crisis in decades and anti-government protests. In Nepal, remittances by overseas workers, which constitute nearly a quarter of the economy and are crucial for external payments, fell 3.0% to $5.3 billion between mid-July to mid-March, compared with a 5% increase in the same period a year earlier. Earnings from tourism, which fell sharply after the start of the pandemic in 2020, are slowly picking up, but remain well below pre-COVID levels. Sharma said if 100,000 Nepali nationals living abroad deposited $10,000 each in Nepali banks it could go a long way to help Nepal overcome the current liquidity constrains. Nepal has also decided to accept $659 million in aid from the United States and about $150 million in soft loan from the World Bank, Sharma said.

He had previously told lawmakers there were no parties and guidance was always followed. In details released late on Saturday, Johnson's office said the British leader would use his trip to India to deepen relations, including in-depth talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mod on the two nations' ""strategic defence, diplomatic and economic partnership"". He will also push for progress in talks on a free trade deal, which Britain is hoping to strike as part of its post-Brexit strategy. His office said such a trade deal was predicted to boost Britain's total trade by up to 28 billion pounds ($36.5 billion) annually by 2035. But the visit will be overshadowed in part by disagreement over the Ukraine conflict.

The Mass was attended by Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who was detained by Russian forces last month and later freed in a prisoner exchange.  Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re replaced the pope as the main celebrant at the service, which involved a procession in near-total darkness up the central nave of Christendom's largest church. The pope sat at the front of Saint Peter's Basilica in a large white chair on the side, appeared alert and stood during the reading of the gospel. He read his homily while sitting but in his normal voice and later rose to baptize seven adult converts to Catholicism. The pope departed from his prepared text to acknowledge the presence of Fedorov, his family and three Ukrainian parliamentarians sitting in the front. He spoke of the ""darkness of war, of cruelty"". ""All of us pray for you and with you. We pray because there is so much suffering. We can only give you our company, our prayers and say to you 'courage, we accompany you,'"" Francis said.

The heavy downpours in Kwazulu-Natal Province have already knocked out power lines, shut off water services and disrupted operations at one of Africa's busiest ports of Durban, the main eastern coastal city.  In Umlazi, one of the country's largest townships, south of Durban, flood victims huddled under blankets in a community hall, while others formed long queues for handouts of food and water donated by charities. ""What makes me angry is that this situation is always happening,"" Mlungeli Mkokelwa, a 53-year-old man who arrived at the settlement a decade ago to look for work that he never found, told Reuters TV. ""Our possessions keep getting destroyed by continuous floods that should be addressed by authorities. No one ever comes back with a plan to solve it."" Climate change activists are calling for investments to help communities around the world better prepare for worsening weather, as Africa's southeastern coast is expected to see more violent storms and floods in the coming decades linked to human emissions of heat-trapping gases. While the east coast suffers more violent rainstorms, other drier parts of the country have in recent years been hit with devastating floods, also blamed on climate change, that have wiped out crops and led to water rationing. The latest rains, which have left at least 40,000 people with no shelter, power or water this week, are expected to continue until early next week. ""We've got no water, no electricity, even our phones are dead.

Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, won the presidency in 2017 after easily beating Le Pen when voters rallied behind him in the runoff to keep her far-right party out of power. This year, the first round of voting last Sunday set up the same battle, but Macron is facing a much tougher challenge. In central Paris, thousands of people gathered chanting anti-far right slogans and warning of democratic upheaval if Le Pen were to win. One banner read: ""Against the far-right. For justice and equality, not Le Pen at the Elysee,"" referring to the French president's official residence. ""If the far-right is in power we will see a major collapse of the democratic, anti-racism and progressive camps,"" Dominique Sopo, president of SOS Racism, which along with dozens of rights groups, unions and associations called for the protests, told Reuters. ""People need to realise that despite their anger towards Emmanuel Macron and his policies, there is no equivalence between a liberal, conservative candidate and a far-right candidate."" Police had warned of possible incidents as demonstrators convened in some 30 cities, but the protests ended peacefully.

Canberra is concerned the security deal, details of which have not been publicised, could foreshadow a Chinese military presence fewer than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) from Australia. Despite a national election campaign putting the Australian government in caretaker mode, an Australian minister this week met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in Honiara and asked him not to sign the proposed agreement.

""But there is also a concern that there has been a lack of transparency in relation to this agreement,"" Payne said. She described as ""very important"" recent assurances from Sogavare that no Chinese military base would be established in the Solomons Islands if the deal with China went ahead. Officials from China and Solomon Islands have initialled but not yet signed the security pact, which Australia, New Zealand, United States and some Pacific island neighbours have criticised as undermining regional stability.  The agreement has sparked concerns among U.S. allies Australia and New Zealand about Chinese influence in a region where they have for decades held strong sway.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Ukraine says fighting rages in Mariupol, blasts rattle Kyiv Ukraine said on Friday it was trying to break Russia's siege of Mariupol as fighting raged around the city's massive steel works and port, and the capital Kyiv was rocked by some of the most powerful explosions in two weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the military situation in the south and east of the country was ""still very difficult,"" while praising the work of his armed forces. ""The successes of our military on the battlefield are really significant, historically significant. But they are still not enough to clean our land of the occupiers. We will beat them some more,"" Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address, calling again for allies to send heavier weapons and for an international embargo on Russian oil. Russia said it struck what it described as a factory on the outskirts of Kyiv that made and repaired anti-ship missiles, in apparent retaliation for the sinking on Thursday of the Moskva, the flagship of Moscow's Black Sea fleet. Ukraine said one of its missiles had caused the Moskva to sink, a powerful symbol of its resistance to a better-armed foe. Moscow said the ship sank while being towed in stormy seas after a fire caused by an explosion of ammunition. The United States believes the Moskva was hit by two Ukrainian missiles and that there were Russian casualties, although numbers were unclear, a senior U.S. official said. Russia has said more than 500 sailors on board the Moskva were evacuated after the blast. Neither that assertion nor the U.S. assessment could be independently verified.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"China cuts reserve requirements for banks as economy slows China said on Friday it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the first time this year, releasing about 530 billion yuan ($83.25 billion) in long-term liquidity to cushion a sharp slowdown in economic growth. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for all banks by 25 basis points (bps), effective from April 25, but analysts said it might not yet be enough to reverse the slowdown. Heightened global risks from the war in Ukraine and within China widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and a weak property market have triggered convulsions in the world's second-largest economy that are quickly spilling over into global supply chains. China's exports, the last major driver of growth, are also showing signs of fatigue, and some economists say the risks of a recession are rising.  ""I don’t think this RRR cut matters that much for the economy at this stage,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, noting it was less than markets had expected. ""The main challenge the economy faces is the Omicron outbreaks and the lockdown policies that restrict mobility. More liquidity may help on the margin, but it doesn’t address the root of the problem,"" he said. The PBOC said the latest RRR cut would boost the long-term funds for banks, enabling them to step up support for industries and firms affected by COVID-19 outbreaks, and lower costs for banks. It will cut financial institutions' annual funding costs by about 6.5 billion yuan. The PBOC will also continue to keep liquidity broadly stable, while closely watching inflationary trends and policy changes made by developed countries, it said. For city commercial banks that do not have cross-provincial business and rural commercial banks that have an RRR of more than 5%, they are entitled to an additional cut of 25 bps. The weighted average RRR for financial institutions will be lowered to 8.1% after the cut, the central bank said.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cuts-reserve-requirements-banks-economy-slows-2022-04-15/

The traditional Via Crucis procession at Rome's Colosseum had become embroiled in controversy earlier this week when the programme showed that the two friends, a nurse and a student nurse at a Rome hospital, would take part. The candlelight service consists of the 14 Stations of the Cross, stages between the condemnation of Jesus to death and his burial. It is often customised so that those who carry the cross from one station to the next reflect world events. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, head of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, called their inclusion inopportune and ambiguous because it did not ""take into account the context of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine"". The original text of the meditation the two women had written spoke of death, loss of values, rage, resignation, and reconciliation despite bombings. Shevchuk said the text, which had been approved by the Vatican, was ""incoherent and even offensive, especially in the context of the expected second, even bloodier attack of Russian troops on our cities and villages"". Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, also expressed his unease. On Friday night, the original text of some 200 words was replaced with two sentences: ""Faced with death, silence is the most eloquent of words.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Iran Guards say they have seized two ships with smuggled fuel in Gulf Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Friday they had seized two vessels along the country's coast on the Gulf and the nearby Gulf of Oman for allegedly smuggling fuel. Iran, which has some of the world’s cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall of its currency, has been fighting rampant fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring states and by sea to Gulf Arab countries. It has frequently seized boats it says are being used for smuggling oil in the Gulf. Revolutionary Guards naval units seized 250,000 litres of fuel smuggled on one of the ships and 130,000 litres on the other vessel, bringing the total of confiscated fuel in the past week to 650,000 litres, according to a statement posted on the Guards' official website. The first ship's seven crew members have been detained, a Guards official told state TV earlier, adding that they included Iranians and foreigners, without giving further details. Last week the Guards seized a foreign vessel carrying 220,000 litres of smuggled fuel in the Gulf and detained its crew of 11, Iranian media reported.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Romania suspends military MIG-21 flights, to speed up F-16 purchase NATO member Romania has grounded its remaining fleet of military MiG 21 LanceR jets as of Friday given their ""considerably high accident rate"", and will speed up a planned purchase of second-hand F-16s from Norway, the defence ministry said. The move was unrelated to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which shares a 650-kilometre (400 mile) border with Romania. Romania will continue to fly its small fleet of F-16 fighter jets acquired from Portugal, the ministry said, while allied states also have jets deployed to the country for enhanced air policing missions as part of NATO efforts to boost its eastern flank, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Romania bought its first F-16 jets from Portugal in 2016 as it works to phase out its communist-era MiGs. The ministry said it would speed up the process to buy an additional 32 F-16 jets from Norway, which will give it an additional two air squadrons. ""The available resources of the aircrafts from the three squadrons ensure ... their operation for a minimum of 10 years and will form an air capability of transition to fifth-generation F-35 jets,"" the ministry said. The last accident involving a MiG 21 took place in early March when a jet on air patrol crashed, killing the pilot. Seven soldiers sent to find him on a search-and-rescue helicopter mission also died in a separate crash.  Romania, a NATO member since 2004, plans to raise defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product next year from 2% at present, President Klaus Iohannis said in March. The country currently hosts over 3,000 NATO troops and will have a permanent alliance battlegroup stationed on its territory.

""This is a fantastic turnout,"" the president, wearing a black leather jacket, said as he greeted followers at the event, streamed on social media. Bolsonaro has mobilized motorcycle-riding supporters as he campaigns for re-election in October when he is expected to face former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is leading in opinion polls.  Bolsonaro has promised motor bikers he will end tolls for them on federal roads. Among those riding a bike in the rally was former Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio Freitas, who resigned to run for governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, as Bolsonaro's candidate.  Lula's Workers Party (PT) has complained to Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) that Bolsonaro's motorcades are illegal propaganda because election campaigning only starts officially on Aug. 15 and the president should be fined. Organizers of the motorcade described the rally as a religious event called ""Accelerate for Christ"" and announced it in a video on social media as ""The Apocalypse of motor bikes"" saying it would be the biggest ever. The Sao Paulo government's public security office did not have a number for the turnout of motor cyclists, but said it cost the taxpayer 1 million reais ($212,900) for the deployment of police officers, vehicles and drones to keep it safe and orderly.

Just 9 days ahead of a runoff that will determine who will lead the European Union's second-largest economy for the next five years, opinion polls show Macron is only slightly ahead of Le Pen in a contest that could potentially go either way. The 2021 compensation package for Stellantis (STLA.MI) CEO Carlos Tavares adds up to around 19 million euros ($20.5 million), plus a stock package worth some additional 32 million euros and long-term compensation of about 25 million euros.

The company said in a statement that it does not comment on politicians' positions and said the group had gone from near bankruptcy to a leading position under Tavares' leadership. It added that it had paid out as much to staff as to shareholders - 1.9 billion euros - and said that Tavares' pay was 90% variable depending on company performance and lower than at rivals GM and Ford.

Throngs of people, many from ultranationalist organizations, joined the march from the city center to the nearby Russian embassy, where they fired signal flares, played Russian and Serbian anthems and hailed the two countries as brotherly nations. ""I came to this rally to support Russia and to say a loud and clear 'no' to policies of authorities in Belgrade who made a shameful decision to vote against Russia in the U.N.,"" said Mladen Obradovic, a protester.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Russia may be in default, Moody's says Moody's said Russia may be in default because it tried to service its dollar bonds in roubles, which would be one of the starkest consequences to date of Moscow's exclusion from the Western financial system since President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. If Moscow is declared in default, it would mark Russia's first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, though the Kremlin says the West is forcing a default by imposing crippling sanctions. Russia made a payment due on April 4 on two sovereign bonds - maturing in 2022 and 2042 - in roubles rather than the dollars it was mandated to pay under the terms of the securities. Russia ""therefore may be considered a default under Moody's definition if not cured by 4 May, which is the end of the grace period,"" Moody's said in a statement on Thursday. ""The bond contracts have no provision for repayment in any other currency other than dollars."" Moody's said that while some Russian eurobonds issued after 2018 allow payments in roubles under some conditions, those issued before 2018 - such as those maturing in 2022 and 2042 - do not. ""Moody's view is that investors did not obtain the foreign-currency contractual promise on the payment due date,"" Moody's said. The Russian finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Izvestia newspaper earlier this month that if Russia is forced into a default, it will take legal action. Before Putin's Feb. 24 order for what he casts as a special military operation in Ukraine, Russia was rated as investment grade. But its sovereign bonds have become a target in what the Kremlin says is an economic war waged by the United States.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Texas governor strikes deal with Mexican state expected to ease truck traffic jams Texas will halt enhanced inspections of trucks arriving from Mexico after reaching an agreement with the last of four neighboring Mexican states, Governor Greg Abbott said on Friday, a move expected to alleviate costly, long backups over the past week. The agreement calls for the Mexican state of Tamaulipas -- located on the easternmost part of the Texas-Mexico border -- to increase security efforts targeting illegal immigration and drug smuggling, Abbott and Tamaulipas Governor Francisco Garcia Cabeza de Vaca said during a news conference in Weslaco, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. Last week, Abbott, a Republican running for reelection in November, ordered state authorities to conduct ""enhanced safety inspections"" of vehicles as they cross from Mexico into Texas in order to uncover smuggling of people and contraband. The stepped-up inspections, which Abbott said were needed because of President Joe Biden's inability to secure the border, snarled truck traffic and sparked protests by Mexican truckers in their country that shut down several commercial crossings in Texas and New Mexico. The traffic jams caused millions of dollars in losses and prompted pressure from business groups, including the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, an alliance of more than 100 companies involved in the import and distribution of Mexican produce in the United States. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a fellow Republican, urged Abbott on Tuesday to end the additional truck checks, saying they would ""quickly lead to $2.00 lemons, $5.00 avocados and worse."" On Wednesday, the White House slammed the inspections, saying they were unnecessary and had disrupted food and automobile supply chains, driving up prices. Biden, a Democrat, is already battling rising inflation and challenges to the movement of goods stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Abbott has also chartered buses to carry migrants from Texas to Washington to send a message to Biden, with the third bus arriving on Friday, according to the governor's office and news reports. The Texas governor said at Friday's news conference that he could reinstate the truck inspections if the four Mexican states fail to take steps to reduce illegal immigration, even if resulting border backups lead to ""knock-on economic effects."" Abbott and Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), said they found no smuggling attempts during the beefed-up inspections, which followed screening for smuggling and contraband by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-announces-deal-with-mexican-state-expected-ease-truck-traffic-2022-04-15/

Thursday's event will be the first chance for key Ukrainian officials to meet in person with a host of financial officials from advanced economies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Spillovers from Russia's war in Ukraine are expected to dominate next week's meetings of senior economic officials from World Bank and IMF member countries, as well as the G7 and G20, with the IMF poised to downgrade its forecast for global growth as a result of the war.  Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies say those are bogus justifications for an unprovoked war of aggression that has driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes and led to the deaths of thousands. Thursday's meeting will be more of a roundtable than a donors conference, although both the IMF and World Bank have set up separate accounts to be able to process and relay donations, and additional pledges are expected to be announced next week.

Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused private equity firm that had more than $103 billion in assets under management as of the end of December, has informed Twitter that it is exploring the possibility of putting together a bid, people familiar with the matter said.  It is not clear how much Thoma Bravo would be prepared to offer and there is no certainty that such a rival bid will materialize, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. A Thoma Bravo spokesperson declined to comment while Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Thoma Bravo was considering a bid for Twitter. Twitter said on Friday it adopted a poison pill that would dilute anyone amassing a stake in the company of more than 15% by selling more shares to other shareholders at a discount. Known formally as a shareholder rights plan, the poison pill will be in place for 364 days. The move would not bar Musk from taking his offer directly to Twitter shareholders by launching a tender offer. While the poison pill would prevent most Twitter shareholders from selling their shares, the tender offer would allow them to register their support or disapproval of Musk's offer. ""It is a predictable defensive measure for the board to go down that will not be viewed positively by shareholders given the potential dilution and acquisition unfriendly move,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted on Friday. Thoma Bravo's interest raises the specter of more private equity firms vying for Twitter. The global private equity industry is sitting on about $1.8 trillion in dry powder, according to data provider Preqin. Unlike major technology conglomerates, most buyout firms would not face antitrust restrictions in acquiring Twitter. It remains possible that a private equity firm will boost Musk's bid by partnering with him rather than challenging him. Musk's criticism of Twitter's reliance on advertising for most of its revenue, however, has made some private equity firms apprehensive about teaming up with him, industry sources said. This is because a strong cash flow makes financing a leveraged buyout much easier. Silver Lake, a private equity firm with more than $90 billion in assets under management, would be a natural partner for Musk because it offered financing for his $72-billion bid for Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) four years ago, which Musk subsequently abandoned.

Ukraine used to export almost all its grain and oilseeds via seaports and now is forced to find new routes as its ports are blocked. Before the war, Ukraine exported up to 6 million tonnes of grain and oilseed a month, while in March the exports fell to 200,000 tonnes, Mykola Solskyi told the newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda.

Ukraine traditionally exports grains to the north Africa and the Middle East and Solskyi said these regions would be forced to spend more money and focus on wheat from non-Ukraine origins. He said importers were already spending more and the situation with grain supply from Ukraine could push these countries to build greater grain reserves and this would also drive up prices. ""That is, even if this story ended magically tomorrow, the wave of high prices will be another 3 to 5 years, until the mood levels off, and there will be no balance,"" Solskyi added.

2022-04-15,Reuters,"Soaring costs put Turkey's energy importer under pressure to hike prices Soaring world energy costs are piling pressure on Turkey's state energy importer BOTAS to further hike prices as it falls deeper into the red, even as manufacturers complain that recent price rises threaten their operations. The pipeline operator and trading company needed a 100 billion lira ($6.8 billion) payment from the Treasury last year to cover its shortfall and losses have accelerated since Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove energy prices higher, officials say. That poses several challenges to authorities in Turkey, which imports nearly all its energy needs. BOTAS has bought billions of dollars from the Central Bank to cover its purchases, eroding the bank's already low foreign reserves, while Treasury payments to BOTAS widen the budget deficit. At the same time any price increase imposed by BOTAS on Turkish industry could hurt the government's drive for export-driven economic growth, while also keeping upward pressure on inflation which has topped 60%. Four industrialists that represent some of the most gas- and electricity-intensive sectors, such as steel, ceramics and cement, told Reuters that soaring costs would push up prices of their goods. So far BOTAS has kept its gas prices to consumers and industry well below the $830 per thousand cubic metres which it is paying in April. It said its latest price increases on April 1 still left households with an effective 70% subsidy. ""BOTAS has given significant support to households, power plants and industrial companies. Compared to continental Europe, before the price hike, industry and power plants paid one eighth of the price and households paid one twentieth of the price,"" a senior government official said. ""Now BOTAS is still making serious losses, but this is government policy and the subsidies continue."" Since the end of 2020 BOTAS has hiked the price of natural gas for industry by 568% in lira terms, according to Reuters calculations. That reflects a 49% fall in Turkey's lira against the dollar in that period on top of rising world energy prices. ""Despite the hikes, BOTAS lost billions of dollars in the first quarter. If the current figures continue for the rest of the year, the loss is expected to grow exponentially,"" one source close to the matter said.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/soaring-costs-put-turkeys-energy-importer-under-pressure-hike-prices-2022-04-15/
2022-04-15,Reuters,"Analysis: Jerusalem clashes raise fears of wider conflict One year after events in Jerusalem led to war in Gaza, clashes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan are raising fears of renewed Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with leaders on both sides warning of possible escalation. At least 152 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli riot police entered the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Friday to disperse Palestinians who threw firecrackers and stones at them and towards a Jewish prayer area. The Al-Aqsa compound sits on a plateau in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. Known to Jews as Temple Mount, the area is the most sensitive in the generations-old conflict. ""Jerusalem is perhaps the number one issue that has the potential of triggering widescale violence,"" said Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. ""We have seen that in the past."" Already strained by deadly attacks on Israelis by Palestinian assailants in the last two weeks and Israeli army killings of Palestinians in the West Bank, the atmosphere in the holy city has been heightened as Ramadan, Passover and Easter are all being marked this month. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh described the Israeli riot police actions at Al-Aqsa as a ""brutal assault on worshipers during the holy month"" and a dangerous omen. At a rally in Gaza, a spokesman for the armed Islamist group Hamas, which rules the enclave, said that Israeli use of force would not go unanswered. ""We will draw the line again in defence of Jerusalem and we will launch a new era; weapons for weapons, and force will only be met by force and we will defend Jerusalem by all our might,"" Fawzi Barhoum said. Last May, Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel after Hamas demanded Israeli police withdraw from Al-Aqsa and the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where a court threat to dispossess Palestinian residents had led to protests and confrontation.

The arrest of Charahzed Akacha on Thursday caused widespread anger and was widely seen by activists and journalists as a setback to freedom of expression since President Kais Saied seized executive power last summer. ""Akacha was released,"" her lawyer Samir Dilou said. The news was confirmed by an official at the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists, Amira Mohamed. The union said Akacha's arrest on Thursday was due to a Facebook post in which she criticised Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine and accused police of insulting and beating her in the street last week. In her post, Akacha called on the interior minister to control his policemen, describing them as ""dogs"", after she said they beat her, insulted her and took off her veil. The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters request for comment. Improved speech and press freedoms were a key gain for Tunisians after the 2011 revolution that ended the rule of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered the Arab Spring protests.

The fuel crisis in Kenya is in its second week and has seen traffic in parts of the capital Nairobi come to a standstill as desperate motorists joined snaking queues outside petrol stations, blocking major roads. Government officials blame the shortage on oil marketing companies, accusing them of hoarding supplies ahead of a price hike, which comes into effect on Friday. Oil companies have pointed to subsidy arrears owed to them by the state. Local media reported that the government had deported the CEO of fuel storage and distribution company Rubis Energy Kenya over the fuel crisis. Energy minister Monica Juma confirmed that the CEO, Jean-Christian Bergeron, had left the country on Wednesday night but declined to give further details. Bergeron has led the Kenyan subsidiary of France's Rubis Energie (RUBF.PA) for three years. Local media said his work visa had been revoked. Bergeron and the interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment.  ""The CEO of Rubis Energy Kenya joined the head office in Paris to give a full update on the situation of the subsidiary,"" Rubis Energie said in a statement in French on Thursday, without giving further details on Bergeron's return to France. Kenya's petroleum regulator said on Thursday it was increasing national fuel prices by 9.90 Kenyan shillings per litre, effective from Friday. Juma said she had sanctioned a process of reallocating the petroleum import capacity and the fuel crisis should ease within 72 hours. ""This situation can only be equated to deliberate efforts to sabotage this economy, which constitutes a capital crime,"" she said. ""The oil marketing companies who sold above their normal local quota during the crisis period will benefit from additional capacity; while those who sold less will have their respective capacities reduced,"" Juma said, without giving more details about quota changes.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov wrote to Economy Minister Paulo Guedes asking for Brazil's ""support to prevent political accusations and discrimination attempts in international financial institutions and multilateral fora."" ""Behind the scenes work is underway in the IMF and World Bank to limit or even expel Russia from the decision-making process,"" Siluanov wrote. He did not elaborate on obstacles to Russian participation in those institutions, and his allegations could not be independently verified.

Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the NATO alliance. Finland will decide in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday.  Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea. Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012. Medvedev said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense. If not, he said, they would have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. When asked how Washington views the potential addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO in light of Russia's warning, the U.S. State Department said there was no change in Washington's position and repeated that ""NATO's open door is an open door."" ""Without speaking to any countries in particular, we would not be concerned that the expansion of a defensive alliance would do anything other than promote stability on the European continent,"" Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing.

2022-04-14,Reuters,"Analysis: Hawkish Fed and China lockdowns threaten Brazil's world-beating FX rally The Brazilian currency's monster rally may soon run out of gas, analysts and government officials say, as U.S. interest rate hikes and risks to the Chinese economy threaten the fundamentals of the world's best-performing major currency. Brazil's real has gained over 18% against the U.S. dollar so far this year, more than twice the rise of any other peer, as aggressive rate hikes drew in foreign investment flows seeking distance from the Ukraine war. While Brazil's double-digit interest rates may still offer a lucrative carry trade for hot money, looming rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve may narrow that gap quickly. China's aggressive lockdowns to fight COVID-19 have also weighed on prices for the iron ore, soybeans and oil that Brazil exports. ""There are two big risks to the real's performance: the Fed raising rates more than expected and a sharp deceleration in the Chinese economy that could affect commodity prices,"" said Alvaro Mollica, emerging markets strategist for Citigroup. A note from his colleagues at Citi Economics on Thursday flagged ""a weaker currency ahead"" for Brazil, forecasting a year-end exchange rate of 5.19 reais per dollar – a nearly 10% depreciation from Wednesday's close. Even in Brazil's Economy Ministry, which has trumpeted the jump in foreign investment and perks of a stronger currency for fighting inflation, some officials doubt the trend will continue indefinitely. Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's government, which generated huge initial optimism among investors, has had a mixed record on reforms as well as privatizing state assets. ""I haven't seen any structural factor, unfortunately. It all seems circumstantial,"" said one official, requesting anonymity to give a frank assessment of the market. ""The dollar came way down, even below where some institutions see its equilibrium ... I think there's room for some reversal."" The same official pointed out that Brazil's main stock exchange, which has attracted a net 69 billion reais ($14.7 billion) in foreign flows this year, no longer looks so cheap in dollars or reais after an 11% runup this year. Another ministry source agreed that, apart from Brazil's interest rates, the major drivers of the currency rally have been ""external"" and are subject to change.

Concerns over immigration were a big factor in the 2016 Brexit vote, and Johnson has been under pressure to deliver on his promise to ""take back control"" of Britain's borders. But his plan drew swift criticism from opponents of his Conservative Party and from charities. ""We must ensure that the only route to asylum in the UK is a safe and legal one,"" Johnson said in a speech in Kent, southeast England, where thousands of migrants in small boats landed on Channel beaches last year. ""Those who try to jump the queue or abuse our systems will find no automatic path to set them up in our country, but rather be swiftly and humanely removed to a safe third country or their country of origin."" Anyone who has arrived in Britain illegally since Jan. 1 could now be relocated to Rwanda, which would disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, the prime minister said. ""The deal we have done is uncapped and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead,"" he said.

A report Canada submitted to the United Nations on Thursday showed that greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 66 megatonnes annually in 2020, Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said in a statement, describing the drop as being equivalent to taking 20 million cars off the road. That included a 27-megatonne drop in transportation emissions, mainly due to people not driving and flying during pandemic-related lockdowns. ""This is the first report that tracks the impacts of the pandemic on emissions in Canada,"" Guilbeault said. ""So we must be mindful that overall emissions are likely to rebound to a degree as Canada's economy roars back to life.""

Burns' most extensive public comments since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 underscored concerns that the biggest attack against a European state since 1945 risks escalating to the use of nuclear weapons. Earlier on Thursday, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, warned NATO that Moscow would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave in the heart of Europe, if Sweden and Finland joined the Atlantic alliance.  Burns spoke at Georgia Tech of the ""potential desperation"" and setbacks dealt Putin, whose forces have suffered heavy losses and have been forced to retreat from some parts of northern Ukraine after failing to capture Kyiv. For those reasons, ""none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,"" Burns said. That said, despite ""rhetorical posturing"" by the Kremlin about putting the world's largest nuclear arsenal on high alert, ""We haven't seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that would reinforce that concern.” Tactical and low-yield nuclear weapons refer to those designed for use on the battlefield, of which some experts estimate Russia has about 2,000 that can be delivered by air, naval and ground forces. Burns' comments came in response to a question from former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, a leading arms control advocate, at the end of the CIA chief's first public speech since taking the helm of the premier U.S. spy agency in March 2021. In a wide-ranging address, the former career U.S. diplomat said U.S. spy agencies began last fall collecting ""disturbing and detailed"" intelligence on a plan by Putin for a ""major new invasion"" of Ukraine.

Shanghai is battling China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, with its 25 million residents remaining largely under lockdown, though restrictions were partially eased in some areas this week. Wider curbs to stop the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant have led to logistical and supply chain disruptions that are taking a growing economic toll, adding to expectations that China's central bank will soon announce more stimulus measures.  An April 7 study by Gavekal Dragonomics found that 87 of China's 100 largest cities by GDP have imposed some form of quarantine curbs.

Raising hopes for a shift in policy, on Wednesday the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a guide on home quarantining on its social media. The CDC's guide - quarantine in a well-ventilated room stocked with masks, sanitizer and other gear - raised hopes that the central quarantine rule might be relaxed. However, when asked by a social media user in an online comments section about who might be eligible for home quarantine, the CDC referred to the old rules.

The new workshop raises questions about Iran's plans for the manufacturing of advanced centrifuges - machines that produce enriched uranium much faster than the first-generation machines it was restricted to using for that purpose by its 2015 deal with major powers.  It is now enriching with hundreds of advanced centrifuges, some of them enriching to a purity of up to 60%, close to the 90% that is weapons-grade. That is far above the 3.67% cap imposed by the deal and the 20% it had achieved before the deal. In its confidential report to member states the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had finished installing surveillance cameras at the location on April 12 and had then removed the seals from the machines. The agency did not say where at Natanz that location was. The workshop's precise location is of particular interest to Western powers and Iran's arch foe Israel because Karaj was struck by what Tehran says was a sabotage attack by Israel. Tehran has since been seeking to ensure greater security for such sites.  The sprawling Natanz site includes a commercial-scale enrichment plant that is underground, which could offer some protection from any potential airstrikes. ""On 13 April 2022, Iran informed the Agency that the machines would start operating at the new workshop the same day,"" the report said, without saying whether it had verified that the machines had started operating, suggesting it had not had access to the location since then. Under an agreement with Iran struck more than a year ago, the IAEA does not have access to the data collected by cameras and other monitoring equipment from some locations, such as centrifuge-parts workshops.  Before moving the Karaj parts to Natanz, Iran had also told the IAEA it was moving the Karaj workshop's activities to another site at Isfahan, and the IAEA has set up cameras there. If Isfahan went into operation, that would be a big increase in Iran's capacity to produce advanced centrifuge parts.

Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas, and western sanctions over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have hit its energy exports by complicating the financing and logistics of existing deals. While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere,the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world's top energy consumer, and other Asian countries. ""The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won't be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,"" Putin told a televised government meeting. ""There is no rational replacement (for Russian gas) in Europe now."" Putin also said that Europe, by talking about cutting off energy supplies from Russia, was driving up prices and destabilising the market. He said Russia, which accounts for around a tenth of global oil production and around a fifth of gas, would need new infrastructure to boost energy supplies to Asia.

2022-04-14,Reuters,"Worldwide COVID cases surpass 500 mln as Omicron variant BA.2 surges Global COVID-19 cases surpassed 500 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, as the highly contagious BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron surges in many countries in Europe and Asia. The rise of BA.2 has been blamed for recent surges in China as well as record infections in Europe. It has been called the ""stealth variant"" because it is slightly harder to track than others.  South Korea leads the world in the daily average number of new cases, reporting more than 182,000 new infections a day and accounting for one in every four infections globally, according to a Reuters analysis. New cases are rising in 20 out of more than 240 countries and territories tracked, including Taiwan, Thailand and Bhutan. Shanghai is fighting China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, with almost 25,000 new local cases reported, although the city's quarantine policy is criticized for separating children from parents and putting asymptomatic cases among those with symptoms.  ""Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,"" Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission, told a briefing.  Some European countries are now seeing a slower uptick in new cases, or even a decline, but the region is still reporting over 1 million cases about every two days, according to the Reuters tally. In Germany, the seven-day average of new infections has fallen and is now at 59% of its previous peak in late March. New cases are also falling in the United Kingdom and Italy, while they are holding steady in France. Overall, COVID-19 cases in the United States have dropped sharply after hitting record levels in January, but the resurgence of cases in parts of Asia and Europe has raised concerns that another wave could follow in the United States. The U.S. national public health agency said on Monday the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron was estimated to account for nearly three of every four coronavirus variants in the country.

Video provided to Reuters on Thursday by an occupant of the facility showed more than 100 people crammed on a floor of what looked like an office building, one of dozens of places the city has converted into quarantine centres in its battle to stem the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.  ""This centre is so crowded, everyone is less than a metre apart,"" said the woman, aged over 60, who filmed the video and provided it to Reuters.

Makari said the decision was based on a ""technical report"" that concluded the silos could collapse in the coming months, adding it would be too expensive to renovate them. Families of victims have called for the gutted grain silos to remain in place as a memorial, at least until a stalled probe into the chemical explosion can conclude. Following the Cabinet's decision, a few dozen protesters, including family members of victims, gathered on a road near the remains of the structures.

A federal jury in the District of Columbia found Dustin Thompson, 38, guilty on all charges he faced, including obstruction of an official proceeding and theft of government property. Thompson had admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a bottle of liquor and a coat rack during the riots. But in a novel legal strategy, Thompson argued to the jury that he was acting at Trump's behest and that the former president is ultimately responsible for the mob that stormed the Capitol. “Besides being ordered by the president to go to the Capitol, I don’t know what I was thinking,” Thompson told the jury, according to CNN. “I was caught up in the moment.” U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, who oversaw the trial, will sentence Thompson at a hearing in July. The judge ordered Thompson detained in jail until that hearing. The U.S. Justice Department has now won all three Jan. 6 prosecutions that have gone to a jury trial.

Stall-owner Amadou saw the soldiers fan out across town on the morning of March 27, and ran home. They arrested him hours later and took him to a riverbank on the outskirts of town, where thousands of men sat with their hands tied. Over the next four days, the men stayed in the blazing sun with little food or water and watched as soldiers gradually took groups aside, led them to the lip of a mass grave and shot them, Amadou and two other witnesses told Reuters. ""It was unimaginable,"" he said, overcome with exhaustion and emotion. ""They came, they took 15, 20 people and lined them up. They made them kneel down and shot them.""

Prosecutors said earlier on Thursday they had detained four people suspected of plotting to kidnap the minister and destroy power facilities to cause a nationwide power outage. ""This is small minority in our society but they are highly dangerous,"" Lauterbach told a news conference. The suspects were affiliated with groups that protested against COVID-19 restrictions, and with the far-right ""Reichsbuerger"" movement, which denies the existence of the modern German state, the prosecutor's office in the western city of Koblenz said in a statement. ""This shows that COVID protests have not just radicalised but that this is about more than just COVID,"" Lauterbach said. The plot to kidnap him is the latest in a series of incidents that have highlighted the anger of some Germans over restrictions on those not vaccinated and proposals to make vaccination compulsory for the general public. In December, police foiled a plot by anti-vaccination activists to murder the state premier of Saxony in eastern Germany.  Germany's vaccination campaign is faltering with around 76.6% of the population having received at least one dose - less than in other western European countries such as Italy or Spain, where the figures are well above 80%. Germany's lower house of parliament last week rejected mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for people over 60, in another defeat for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who already had to drop plans for vaccine mandate for all adults because he could not muster a parliamentary majority.

2022-04-14,Reuters,"Bird flu, Ukraine war push egg prices higher worldwide Severe outbreaks of bird flu in the United States and France are tightening global egg supplies and raising prices for the food staple as the war in Ukraine disrupts shipments to Europe and the Middle East. Higher prices are particularly painful for consumers who rely on eggs as a low-cost source of protein and substitute for more expensive meat. Demand jumps around the Easter and Passover holidays in the United States and Europe as families use eggs to bake and dye Easter eggs. Bird flu has wiped out more than 19 million egg-laying chickens on commercial U.S. farms this year in the worst outbreak since 2015, eliminating about 6% of the country's flock, according to Reuters calculations of federal and state government data. France, meanwhile, is suffering its worst outbreak ever in which about 8% of egg-laying hens have been culled.  When poultry are infected, entire flocks are culled to contain the disease, which is often spread by wild birds.  The deadly virus and war are the latest challenges for egg suppliers also grappling with labor shortages and high costs for energy and grain used for animal feed. Higher egg prices eat into profits for bakeries and food companies grappling with increased costs for flour and other goods. World food prices jumped nearly 13% in March to a new record high as the war in Ukraine, a major exporter of wheat and corn, pushed up grain prices, the U.N. food agency said.  Egg prices are expected to stay elevated, producers said, as it will take months to resume operations on infected farms. Infections also hamper work at facilities that process shell eggs into products like dried eggs and liquid eggs used in food items such as cake and pancake mixes and egg sandwiches. ""The product industry is in a general panic,"" said Marcus Rust, chief executive of Rose Acre Farms, the second-largest U.S. egg producer. The company lost about 1.5 million egg-laying chickens at an Iowa farm infected by bird flu, which also sidelined a processing plant, he said. Iowa, the top U.S. egg-producing state, has suffered badly with the culling of two flocks that each contained more than 5 million laying chickens. On Wednesday, Nebraska said a flock of more than 1.7 million laying hens would be culled. The sheer size of such poultry operations accelerated the impact on the U.S. food industry, compared to Europe where farms are smaller. Wholesale prices for large eggs in the U.S. Midwest topped $3 per dozen in March and reached the second-highest level ever, up nearly 200% from a year earlier on the spot market, data firm Urner Barry said. Prices remained below the record of $3.09 per dozen set at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2022-04-14,Reuters,"EU closes loophole allowing multimillion-euro arms sales to Russia The European Union has closed a loophole that allowed EU governments to export weapons worth tens of millions of euros to Russia last year alone despite an embargo which took effect in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region. EU countries last year sold to Russia weapons and ammunition worth 39 million euros ($42.3 million), according to the latest data made available by the EU Commission - up more than 50% from 2020, when sales were worth 25 million euros, a volume in line with previous years. The EU had banned the export of arms to Moscow in July 2014 in reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea, but a clause in the sanctions permitted sales under contracts signed before August 2014. Countries with large defence industries, such as France and Germany, were among the largest exporters. The loophole has come under fire from some EU governments since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which the Kremlin calls ""a special military operation"". In a bid to weaken the Kremlin's war efforts in Ukraine, the EU has imposed five rounds of sweeping sanctions banning exports to Russia of a large variety of technology that could be used by the defence industry. But EU governments failed to immediately agree to scrap the exemption on arms sales until last week, when the loophole was closed as part of the fifth package of EU sanctions, EU diplomats and officials told Reuters. A legal text published on April 8 in the EU official journal deletes that exemption. The EU Commission did not mention the closure of the loophole in its public communication about the fifth package of sanctions.

Labour practices across the Southeast Asian country have come under scrutiny in the past two years, with six companies including Sime Darby banned by U.S. customs over forced labour allegations.  Palm oil, the most widely used vegetable oil, is a key ingredient in Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread, giving the iconic products their smooth texture and shelf life. ""On 6th April, we have requested all our direct suppliers to stop supplying Ferrero with palm oil and palm kernel oil sourced indirectly from Sime Darby, until further notice,"" Ferrero told Reuters by email.

Although Ferrero buys relatively little of the edible oil from Sime Darby, its move - following similar halts by Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), Hershey Co (HSY.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) - could hurt Sime Darby's standing as a leader in sustainably produced palm oil.

The go-ahead is the sixth COVID vaccine approval by Britain and comes even though London last September scrapped a 1.4 billion euro ($1.5 billion) deal to buy the Valneva shot, alleging the company was in breach of its obligations under the agreement - which Valneva denied. The company said it was in discussions to supply up to 25,000 doses to the UK's National Health Service and frontline workers in Scotland. It said talks over a settlement following the UK government's decision to ditch its contract continued. Announcing the approval, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MRHA) said it was the first, whole-virus inactivated COVID-19 vaccine to gain approval in the UK, adding the shot met safety, quality and effectiveness standards. However demand prospects could be limited in the UK given the vaccination rate is already relatively high, with about 73% of the population having had two doses and almost 60% having had a booster. The government is also rolling out fourth doses to the vulnerable and the elderly.

Still, the regulatory nod is a boost for the company as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) assesses the vaccine for possible approval.

2022-04-14,Reuters,"Petrobras elects new CEO, who pledges to maintain pricing policies Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) on Thursday formally elected Jose Mauro Coelho as its chief executive for a one-year term, ending weeks of turmoil in which the government struggled to fill the top position. Coelho, a government technocrat, pledged to maintain the company's current pricing policy, a controversial topic that ultimately helped bring down his two predecessors. The oil giant pegs its fuel prices to international crude prices rather than subsidising fuel for Brazilians. This is an election year and many Brazilians have demanded that Petrobras limit price increases for gasoline and diesel, which have soared recently, hurting President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity. ""Market prices are a necessary condition to create a competitive business environment, attract investment and new players, expand the country's infrastructure, and secure supply,"" the new CEO said during his inaugural speech. He also said the company would keep divesting from mature, smaller oilfields and refineries, while focusing on the pre-salt and deepwater fields. Coelho was Bolsonaro's second pick to replace retired army general Joaquim Silva e Luna, who was ousted in March after disagreeing with the far-right leader on the firm's fuel pricing policy. Bolsonaro initially tapped well-known academic and energy consultant Adriano Pires for the role, but he ended up turning it down as he could not reconcile his consulting job with Petrobras' command, paving the way for Coelho's nomination.  Coelho previously served as the secretary of oil, gas and biofuels at Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry. Coelho's election came right after the company voted him onto its board earlier in the day, as under Petrobras' statutes the chief executive is required to be on the board.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/petrobras-shareholders-poised-elect-new-ceo-after-weeks-turmoil-2022-04-13/
2022-04-14,Reuters,"Thousands of Sri Lankans celebrate New Year at anti-government protest site At an auspicious time early on Thursday, Dilani Jayaratne lit a small wood fire to boil a small pot of milk to mark the start of Sri Lanka's New Year. The island nation's Sinhala and Tamil communities usually conduct the ceremony at home. But this year, Jayaratne and her family were at a tent camp in Sri Lanka's commercial capital Colombo, where thousands of people are protesting against the government's handling of a devastating economic crisis. Demonstrations have raged across Sri Lanka for weeks as people angered by prolonged power cuts and shortages of fuel and medicine demand President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation. Jayaratne, 38, said she left home with her husband and two young sons around dawn and travelled for more than an hour to reach the protest site in Colombo located near Rajapaksa's office, which has been named ""Gota-Go Village"" by some. ""We cannot just sit at home,"" said Jayaratne, adding that she hoped the protests would pressure Rajapaksa to leave the presidency. Behind her, dozens of protesters lined up outside a tent where volunteers were distributing squares of kiribath or coconut milk rice, bananas, spicy pickles, and butter cake on paper plates - traditional New Year delicacies that were donated by supporters. ""We used to say best wishes for the New Year,"" said Jayaratna Teekanoon, 56, as he handed out bananas. ""Now we say best wishes for the struggle."" In a New Year's message, Rajapaksa said the current crisis was the biggest challenge the country had faced in recent years. ""We should overcome this challenge with unity and better understanding,"" he said in a statement. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka said it would suspend repayment of external debts ahead of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a loan programme, instead using its meagre foreign reserves to provide essentials to its 22 million people. Besides shortages, Sri Lankans are also struggling with rocketing inflation that has hit middle-class families like that of K.D.H.

It signals the latest move by crypto and incumbent financial networks to join forces as digital assets become more mainstream. Nexo said the card, available in selected European countries initially, allows users to spend without having to sell their digital assets such as bitcoin, which are used as collateral to back the credit granted. Most traditional credit cards are unsecured and have a set credit limit. The card is linked to a Nexo-provided, crypto-backed credit line and can be used at 92 million merchants worldwide where Mastercard is accepted, allowing investors to spend up to 90% of the fiat value of their crypto assets, Nexo said. ""The card requires no minimum repayments, monthly, or inactivity fees. There are no FX fees for up to 20,000 euros per month,"" Nexo said. There are no restrictions on how much a customer can spend or withdraw from the open credit line and interest is only paid on the amount of credit actually used. Interest remains at 0% for customers who maintain a loan-to-value ratio of 20% or below.

The Japanese yen weakened past the 126 yen per dollar mark on Wednesday for the first time since 2002, while the euro was pinned at a one-month low as investors bought the U.S. currency after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials. The prospect of fast and aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes and growing market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep rates ultra-low in the near term have fueled the Japanese currency's declines against the dollar. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields fell - and data on inflation did not dissuade investors from believing that inflation may have peaked. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) rose 0.03% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.79%. Equity markets have suffered from hawkish moves from the world's top central banks in response to inflation, analysts said.

Interfax said all the crew had been evacuated. It cited the ministry as blaming the blast on a fire and said the cause was being investigated.

Biden said he had also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, saying equipment provided to Ukraine ""has been critical"" as it confronts the invasion. ""We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,"" Biden said in a written statement. The new package includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had been earmarked for Afghanistan before the U.S.-backed government collapsed last year. It also includes 18 155mm howitzers, along with 40,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, 200 armored personnel carriers and 300 additional ""Switchblade"" drones.

2022-04-13,Reuters,"Analysis: China's widening COVID curbs threaten global supply chain paralysis China's race to stop the spread of COVID-19 is clogging highways and ports, stranding workers and shutting countless factories While some factory owners try to tough it out through ""closed loop"" management that keeps workers isolated inside, some said that is becoming harder to sustain given the extent of local COVID-19 curbs aimed at heading off the Omicron variant, complicating efforts to procure materials or ship products. Foxconn Interconnect Technology (6088.HK), a unit of Taiwan-based Foxconn (2317.TW) that makes data transmission equipment and connectors, has kept a plant open in Kunshan, which borders Shanghai, in a closed loop but is only able to run at 60% of capacity, a person familiar with the matter said. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, more than 30 Taiwan companies, many making electronics parts, said that COVID-19 measures in eastern China had led them to suspend production until at least next week.  A day earlier, German auto parts giant Bosch said it suspended output at sites in Shanghai and Changchun, while putting two other plants under ""closed-loop"" operation. Also on Tuesday, Taiwan's Pegatron Corp (4938.TW), which assembles Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones, halted operations in Shanghai and Kunshan. Sven Agten, Asia Pacific CEO of Rheinzink, a German maker of zinc construction materials, said logistical challenges make a closed-loop unworkable at his Shanghai warehouse and manufacturing facilities, and expects to have zero sales during April and possibly May. ""We need somebody in the warehouse and the manufacturing facility to do the work, and we need a truck and a driver. These are the two key components, and both are impossible,"" he told Reuters. China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19, despite low case numbers and even as the rest of the world tries to live with the coronavirus, is proving unwieldy given the extreme infectiousness of the less-deadly Omicron variant. The zeal to cut-off virus transmission chains means localised curbs extend far beyond virus hotspots Shanghai and Jilin province in the northeast.

Finland and fellow Nordic state and neighbour Sweden are close partners with NATO but have shied away from joining the 30-member alliance, founded in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union during the Cold War. ""We have to be prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia,"" Marin told reporters at a joint news conference in Stockholm with her Swedish counterpart. She said the option to join NATO had to be carefully analysed but that everything had changed when Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February. ""The difference between being a partner and being a member is very clear and will remain so. There is no other way to have security guarantees than under NATO's deterrence and common defence as guaranteed by NATO's Article 5,"" she said. ""I won't give any kind of timetable when we will make our decisions, but I think it will happen quite fast - within weeks not within months,"" said Marin, whose country shares a 1,300-km (810-mile)-long border with Russia to the east. She said it was important to reach consensus in Finland, which fought Soviet invaders during World War Two and has been militarily non-aligned since then, and that political parties would have internal talks and in parliament in coming weeks. Public opinion in Finland has taken a U-turn on NATO, with the most recent poll by private broadcaster MTV showing 68% of respondents in favour of joining, with only 12% against.

Around 50 tonnes of the plants were being dried in a warehouse for processing into cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound that is increasingly used to treat anxiety, insomnia and other ailments. Located in the rural northern region of Navarre, the plantation was spread across 11 fields with a combined area of 67 hectares (166 acres), the Guardia Civil force said in a statement. While CBD sale and consumption is legal across Spain and most of Europe, Spanish law still prohibits the cultivation of cannabis plants for anything other than industrial uses, such as for textiles and seeds, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Growing hemp for conversion into CBD or other derivatives remains a criminal offence. Three people were arrested as a result of the operation, which began in mid-2021 when police discovered one of the fields.

Ties between China and the West have long been strained by trade and human rights issues and the tension has grown following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which China has refused to condemn. The United States said last week China could face consequences if it helped Russia to evade Western sanctions that have included financial measures that restrict Russia's access to foreign currency and make it complicated to process international payments.  CNOOC did not immediately comment. Companies periodically carry out reviews of their portfolios, but the exit being prepared would take place less than a decade after state-owned CNOOC entered the three countries via a $15 billion acquisition of Canada's Nexen, a deal that transformed the Chinese champion into a leading global producer. The assets, which include stakes in major fields in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and large Canadian oil sand projects, produce around 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), Reuters calculations found. Last month, Reuters reported CNOOC had hired Bank of America to prepare for the sale of its North Sea assets, which include a stake in one of the basin's largest fields.  CNOOC has launched a global portfolio review ahead of its planned public listing in the Shanghai stock exchange later this month that is aimed primarily at tapping alternative funding following the delisting of its U.S. shares last October, the sources said.

2022-04-13,Reuters,"Hong Kong confirms it will ease COVID restrictions from April 21 Hong Kong confirmed on Thursday it will ease some of the world's most stringent COVID-19 restrictions, allowing beauty parlours, cinemas and gyms to reopen from April 21 as infections in the global financial hub hover below 2,000 per day. The Chinese-ruled city has been hit by a fifth wave of coronavirus since early this year that has battered business and led to more than 8,600 deaths, many in the past two months, although cases have dropped in recent days. Coronavirus restrictions have battered businesss and helped fuel a net outflow of around 70,000 people in February and March, up from nearly 17,000 in December, raising concerns over the city's status as a global financial centre.  The government said on Thursday up to four people could gather at any time from April 21, up from two currently, and restaurants could stay open until 10 p.m., extending opening hours for dining venues across the city from 6 p.m. Schools are also due to resume face-to-face classes from next week. Bars, beaches and barbeque sites remain closed. ""Cases have dropped from a peak of over 70,000 a day to over 1,000 today; if the ... government still doesn't relax (the restrictions), I think it'll have a big impact to Hong Kong's society and economy,"" Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press briefing. The humber of daily infections in Hong Kong have been below 2,000 for a week, and the city recorded 1,272 cases on Wednesday. Hong Kong's border has effectively been shut since 2020 with few flights able to land and hardly any passengers allowed to transit, isolating a city that had built a reputation as a global hub. For some businesses, the relaxations may be too late as many restaurants say they have had to lay off staff as they struggle to pay rent in one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.  Until this year, Hong Kong had been far more successful at controlling the coronavirus than many other cities its size, but the latest wave of infections swamped its world-class medical system, and public confidence in the city government is at an all-time low.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-confirms-it-will-ease-covid-restrictions-april-21-2022-04-14/

Sri Lanka, hit by its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 and on the brink of its first debt default, has been asking friendly nations including India and China for credit lines, food and energy. The Asian giants have already committed billions of dollars in financial support. ""We are definitely looking to help them out and are willing to offer more swap lines and loans,"" said an Indian source aware of various discussions with Sri Lanka. A senior government source in New Delhi said Sri Lanka's warning on Tuesday of defaulting on debt payments was a worry, but that ""we can still give them up to $2 billion in swaps and support"".  Another source familiar with Sri Lanka's thinking said it was seeking India's help to roll over some $2 billion in dues, such as those owed to the South Asia-focussed Asian Clearing Union. The source said the response had been positive from India. All the sources had direct knowledge of the matter or had been briefed on it, but they declined to be named as the discussions were private. India's government and its central bank, as well as Sri Lanka's foreign and finance ministries, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India has so far committed $1.9 billion to Sri Lanka in loans, credit lines and currency swaps. Sri Lanka has also sought another $500 million credit line for fuel. China has extended a $1.3 billion syndicated loan and a $1.5 billion-yuan denominated swap, while negotiations are ongoing for more loans and credit lines.  One of the sources said New Delhi was keen for its southern neighbour to cut its reliance on China. Sri Lanka has an outstanding debt of about $3.5 billion with China - or 10.8% of the island's total - and Beijing has also built ports and roads in the country.

Consumer inflation is likely to clearly accelerate as energy prices rise sharply and companies steadily pass on higher raw material costs to households, Kuroda said. While the BOJ chief said the world's third-largest economy was expected to recover as consumption shows signs of improvement, and robust overseas demand underpin exports, he also warned of risks. ""The outlook, however, remains highly uncertain due to the impact of the pandemic, as well as developments regarding Ukraine and the impact on commodity prices,"" Kuroda said in a speech to an annual meeting of trust banks. He stressed the need to maintain the BOJ's massive stimulus to support an economy yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. ""Recent rising inflation, driven by higher import costs, weighs on Japan's economy by reducing households' real income and corporate profits,"" Kuroda said. The spike in global commodity prices, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, and a weak yen have inflated the cost of imports for resource-poor Japan, threatening to derail a fragile economic recovery. Finance Minister Shinichi Suzuki jawboned markets against pushing down the yen too much, saying earlier on Wednesday that rapid moves in the yen were ""undesirable.""

The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday the bloc will halt part of its training of Mali's armed forces, citing a lack of guarantees from Malian authorities that Russian military contractors would not interfere in the work.  Mali's transitional government, which took power in a 2020 military coup, is battling Islamist militants and has enlisted the help of private military contractors belonging to Russia's Wagner Group.  ""It is clear that in this situation ... the Sahel and above all Mali can only be stable if elections are not postponed again and again, and also regarding the security situation, if Russian actors are not worked with,"" Baerbock told reporters in Mali. Borrell said on Monday the Wagner Group, which is already under EU sanctions accused of human rights abuses, was likely responsible for killing civilians during a military operation in a central Mali town in late March.  Baerbock called on Mali's transitional government to move towards fair elections and also to make progress on reforms, especially to tackle corruption.

The international lender lowered its growth estimate for India, the region's largest economy, to 8% from 8.7% for the current fiscal year to March, 2023 and cut by a full percentage point the growth outlook for South Asia, excluding Afghanistan, to 6.6%. In India, household consumption will be constrained by the incomplete recovery of the labour market from the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the bank said. ""High oil and food prices caused by the war in Ukraine will have a strong negative impact on peoples’ real incomes,” Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for South Asia, said in a statement. The World Bank raised its growth forecast for Pakistan, the region's second-largest economy, for the current year ending in June, to 4.3% from 3.4% and kept next year's growth outlook unchanged at 4%. The region's dependence on energy imports meant high crude prices forced its economies to pivot their monetary policies to focus on inflation rather than reviving economic growth after nearly two years of pandemic restrictions. The World Bank slashed this year's growth forecast for Maldives to 7.6% from 11%, citing its large imports of fossil fuels and a slump in tourism arrivals from Russia and Ukraine.

The opinion survey by PoderData showed Lula drawing 40% of voter intentions versus 35% for Bolsonaro if the October election were held on Wednesday. In mid-March, when Bolsonaro's former justice minister was still in the running, Lula also had 40% support but the incumbent drew just 30%. In a simulated second-round runoff, Lula would beat Bolsonaro 47% to 38%, just nine percentage points, PoderData found, down from the 14-point advantage seen a month ago and a 22-point gap at the start of 2022. Other surveys by major pollsters have also shown Lula's advantage eroding gradually, although they show him with a more comfortable lead. Datafolha put Lula ahead in the first round by 17 percentage points in mid-March, down from 26 in December. PoderData said Bolsonaro has gained 3 points since former Judge Sergio Moro, who quit as justice minister in 2020, said he was dropping out of the race, leading the pollster to exclude his name from the survey. PoderData, the polling arm of news website Poder360, said Lula has a clear lead over Bolsonaro in Brazil's poorer northeast, but the president is ahead in the center-west farm belt and northern Brazil. The gap between voter intentions for Lula and Bolsonaro is within the margin of error in wealthier southern and southeastern Brazil.

The move comes after the world's fourth-largest carmaker expanded its credit business in the United States and launched a major reorganisation in Europe, as CEO Carlos Tavares aims to boost profitability and simplify the company's structure. Stellantis, formed at the start of 2021 through the merger of France's PSA with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), has struggled to sell cars in China and has been looking to reshuffle its strategy in the country where it has joint ventures with Dongfeng and GAC (601238.SS). ""As we continue our push to drive profitable growth in China, we need to also reset our financial services offering in the country,"" said Tavares in a statement. Under the deal, one of Stellantis' financing units and car maker DPCA - co-owned by Stellantis and Dongfeng - have entered into an equity transfer agreement with Dongfeng aimed at transferring the whole of their joint auto financing assets to the Chinese company. In return, Stellantis said it would create a new structure called Auto Finance Co (AFC). Stellantis through its China-based joint ventures represents just 0.5% of the Chinese auto market. DPCA, the joint venture with Dongfeng, sold 100,567 vehicles in 2021, more than doubling annual sales. Its joint venture with GAC sold 20,123 units last year, a 50% decline.

Washington has sought to reassure Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who see the U.S. commitment to the region as waning, by providing additional military support in recent months following the missile and drone attacks on the Gulf nations. Fifth Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said that the task force would, from Sunday, ensure a force presence and deterrent posture in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab and Gulf of Aden.

The policy tightening, the third in the past six months, came as separate data showed Singapore's economic momentum waning over the first quarter.

It also increased slightly the rate of appreciation of the policy band. It was the first time in 12 years that the MAS used these two tools simultaneously to tighten policy, underlining policymakers' worries about potential price instability which has seen the U.S. Federal Reserve set an aggressive path to tightening monetary conditions.

2022-04-13,Reuters,"In Peru's slums, chicken off the menu as soup kitchens struggle with inflation In the hilly slums of Peruvian capital Lima, soup kitchens struggle to feed some of the Andean nation's poorest and most vulnerable residents, cutting proteins and loading up on carbohydrates, as food prices soar. ""The rise in prices is huge,"" said Jenifer Mondalgo, president of the soup kitchen association in the Pamplona Alta slum. ""The chicken that we used to buy ... is now inaccessible. For us as soup kitchens, chicken has ceased to exist."" Mondalgo said they have resorted to pleading at the market for free bones, skins or other remnants so that they can serve at least some animal protein. For years soup kitchens offered lunch at 1 sol (27 cents), but now community leaders have been forced to charge 1.5 soles. As much of the world deals with high inflation triggered by the Ukraine crisis, the stakes are highest in the global South, where the poor have always scrounged for a living and could go hungry any day. The war has also caused a global crunch in fertilizer supplies, which directly affects food costs. In Pamplona Alta, residents foraged for food in the trash. Lima's slums have long been a first stop for Peruvians moving from the Andes into the city in search of better opportunities. Peru's inflation is at its highest in a quarter of a century, with price hikes disproportionately affecting food. The soaring prices have already triggered nationwide protests that have left the government scrambling to find ways to cut costs. Peruvian President Pedro Castillo vowed to lower prices by waiving the sales tax on food staples, a bill that Congress passed late on Tuesday after a lengthy debate on what foods count as essential.  Peru has also raised the minimum wage by 10% to 1,025 soles and offered vouchers to subsidize cooking gas for the most vulnerable.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/perus-slums-chicken-off-menu-soup-kitchens-struggle-with-inflation-2022-04-13/

The ISS study, which ran from the start of 2021 until the end of January this year, concluded the inoculation campaign also prevented more than 500,000 hospitalisations and over 55,000 admissions to intensive care. Italy has registered 161,032 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February 2020, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eighth highest in the world. The country has reported 15.4 million cases to date. Some 79% of Italians have been fully vaccinated and 65% have had a third ""booster"" shot, figures from Our World in Data show. The ISS study estimated that 72% of those whose lives were saved by the vaccines were aged 80 and over, 19% were in the 70-79 age group, 7% were aged 60-69 and 3% under 60. The results were calculated using data on vaccine effectiveness and weekly vaccination numbers to assess their impact on the weekly tallies of cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths. The methodology was originally developed for flu vaccines but has already been applied in other countries for studies on SARS-CoV-2, the public body said in a statement.

2022-04-13,Reuters,"EXCLUSIVE Oil traders to cut Russian oil purchases from May 15 - sources Major global trading houses are planning to reduce crude and fuel purchases from Russia's state-controlled oil companies as early as May 15, sources said, to avoid falling foul of European Union sanctions on Russia. The EU has not imposed a ban on imports of Russian oil in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, because some countries such as Germany are heavily dependent on Russian oil and do not have the infrastructure in place to swap to alternatives. [nL5N2VO3PE] Trading companies are, however, winding down purchases from Russian energy group Rosneft as they seek to comply with language in existing EU sanctions that were intended to limit Russia's access to the international financial system, the sources said. The wording of EU sanctions exempts oil purchases from Rosneft or Gazpromneft, which are listed in the legislation, deemed as ""strictly necessary"" to ensure Europe's energy security. Traders are wrestling with what ""strictly necessary"" means, the sources said. It may cover an oil refinery receiving Russian oil through a captive pipeline, but it may not cover the buying and selling of Russian oil by intermediaries. They are cutting purchases to ensure they comply by May 15, when EU restrictions take effect. The inclusion of Russia's state infrastructure firm Transneft that owns the key ports and pipelines will add a further layer of complexity for any future sales. Trafigura, a major Russian oil buyer, told Reuters it ""will comply in full with all applicable sanctions. We anticipate our traded volumes will be further reduced from 15 May."" Vitol, another big buyer, declined to comment on the May 15 deadline. Vitol has previously said traded volumes of Russian oil ""will diminish significantly in the second quarter as current term contractual obligations decline,” and it will cease trading Russian oil by the end of 2022. The war and sanctions on Russia have already led many western buyers of Russian crude such as Shell to stop new spot purchases.  Refiners in Europe are becoming increasingly reluctant to process Russian crude. That has already disrupted Russian exports, although purchases by India and Turkey have made up for some of the slack. Sales to China also continue unabated.",2 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-oil-traders-cut-russian-oil-purchases-may-15-sources-2022-04-13/

2022-04-12,Reuters,"World Bank to send Ukraine $1.5 billion as food, energy prices spike The World Bank is preparing a $1.5 billion support package for war-torn Ukraine and plans to aid developing countries struggling to keep up with surging food and energy prices, World Bank President David Malpass said on Tuesday. In remarks at the Warsaw School of Economics in Poland, Malpass said the bank was helping Ukraine provide critical services, including paying wages for hospital workers, pensions and social programs. Russia invaded Ukraine in February. ""The World Bank was created in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after World War Two. As we did then, we will be ready to help Ukraine with reconstruction when the time comes,"" Malpass said. Malpass said the package was enabled by Monday's approval of $1 billion in International Development Association (IDA) aid by donor and recipient countries, along with a $100 million IDA payment to neighboring Moldova. A World Bank spokesperson said that in addition to the $1 billion in funding from IDA's 19th replenishment round, the bank's main concessional lending arm, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) would provide $472 million in loan guarantees. The plan still needs full approval by the bank's board of directors in the coming weeks, the spokesperson said, adding that the aid would allow Ukraine to continue ""essential government services during the war."" The World Bank on Sunday forecast that the war would slash Ukraine's economic output this year by 45%, as half of the country's businesses are closed, maritime exports are cut off and much productive capacity is destroyed.  The aid comes on top of about $944 million in fast-disbursing financing approved by the World Bank last month, which also includes donor country contributions. That package includes $350 million in budget support financing from the IBRD.  Malpass has previously said the bank was working on about $3 billion in total near-term aid for Ukraine. He said the World Bank was analyzing global impacts of the war, including the spike in food and energy prices, and is ""preparing a surge crisis response that will provide focused support for developing countries."" The spike in food prices needs immediate attention, with Malpass adding that for every one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are expected to fall into extreme poverty.",3 weeks ago,https://www.reuters.com/business/world-bank-says-it-is-preparing-15-billion-aid-package-ukraine-2022-04-12/

Putin, speaking on Tuesday, said Russia would achieve all of its ""noble"" aims and ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue what it calls a special operation.  Moscow said on March 25, its most recent update, that 1,351 soldiers had been killed since the start of the campaign. Ukraine says the real number is closer to 20,000.

The island nation's reserves have slumped more than two-thirds in the past two years, as tax cuts and the COVID-19 pandemic badly hurt its tourism-dependent economy and exposed the government's debt-fuelled spending. Street protests against shortages of fuel, power, food and medicine have gone on for more than a month. ""We need to focus on essential imports and not have to worry about servicing external debt,"" Central Bank of Sri Lanka's governor, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, told reporters. ""It has come to a point that making debt payments are challenging and impossible."" Weerasinghe said the suspension of payment would be until the country came to an agreement with creditors and with the support of a loan programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The report from the global trade watchdog said the conflict, now in its seventh week, had damaged the world economy at a critical juncture as the coronavirus pandemic - and Chinese lockdowns specifically - continues to weigh on the recovery. ""The economic reverberations of this conflict will extend far beyond Ukraine's borders,"" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference presenting the findings. ""It's now clear that the double whammy of the pandemic and the war has disrupted supply chains, increased inflationary pressures and lowered expectations for output and trade growth."" The Geneva-based body forecast global trade growth in 2023 would inch up to 3.4%, noting that both 2022 and 2023 estimates are less certain than usual due to uncertainty about the conflict. Okonjo-Iweala also warned of a potential food crisis because of disruptions to exports from Ukraine and Russia, both major suppliers of grains and other commodities, that could hit poor countries, including some 35 African importers, the hardest. ""This is why we need to act and act decisively on this issue of food in order to avoid food riots,"" she said, citing the need for more transparent monitoring systems and potential releases of buffer stocks to lower prices.

China has put Shanghai under a tight lockdown since late March and neighbouring Kunshan has also tightened curbs to control the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the city of Wuhan.  Global companies, from phone to chip makers, are highly dependent on China and Southeast Asia for production and have been diversifying their supply chains after the pandemic caused havoc.

""In the best-case scenario, complete resumption of production may not be possible until late April or early May,"" analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities said, adding that Apple could minimise the impact due to its strong supply chain and relationship with the Chinese government. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
