"projects under construction... are recommended to proceed 'steadily' and with 'caution'," crea . "this leaves options open for chinese firms to withdraw if they have sufficient reason and manageable penalties to do so, particularly if projects are earlier stages of construction." the new guidelines indicate that more than a third of all new coal power projects outside of china and india will now be scrapped. “china's new directive is the first of its kind - a large emitter with a majorcarbon footprint committing to enable low-carbon transitions overseas,"  kevp. gallagher, director of boston university'sdevelopment policy center, which tracks china's coal investments. china is still building significant amounts of new capacity domestically, with 33 gw going into construction last , the most since 2016.  imf steering committee forgoes communique due to russian objections russia's refusal to agree to strong language condemning its war ukraine prevented the steering committee of themonetary fund from issuing a formal communique on , the panel's chair .
