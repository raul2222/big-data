kremlasks why zelenskiy is not seeing its proposal the kreml on  that moscow was still waiting for ukraine's response to russia's latest written proposal peace talks between the two sides, and questioned why ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy was unaware of the document. zelenskiy  on  he had not seen or heard about the text the kreml had sent.

"there's no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities... block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can get through," put. mariupol, a major port ukraine's eastern donbas region, sits between areas held by russian separatists and crimea, the black sea peninsula moscow seized 2014. capturing the city would allow russia to link the two areas as intensifies its offensive ukraine's east.  even as putclaims his first big prize since his forces were driven away from the capital kyiv and northern ukraine last month, falls short of the unambiguous victory moscow has sought after months of combat a city reduced to rubble. a late-night address, ukraine's president volodymyr zelenskiy  russia was doing all could "to talk about at least some victories", mobilising new battalion tactical groups.

"projects under construction... are recommended to proceed 'steadily' and with 'caution'," crea . "this leaves options open for chinese firms to withdraw if they have sufficient reason and manageable penalties to do so, particularly if projects are earlier stages of construction." the new guidelines indicate that more than a third of all new coal power projects outside of china and india will now be scrapped. â€œchina's new directive is the first of its kind - a large emitter with a majorcarbon footprint committing to enable low-carbon transitions overseas,"  kevp. gallagher, director of boston university'sdevelopment policy center, which tracks china's coal investments. china is still building significant amounts of new capacity domestically, with 33 gw going into construction last , the most since 2016.  imf steering committee forgoes communique due to russian objections russia's refusal to agree to strong language condemning its war ukraine prevented the steering committee of themonetary fund from issuing a formal communique on , the panel's chair .
